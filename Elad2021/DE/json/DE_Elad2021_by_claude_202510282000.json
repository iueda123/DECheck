[...] we used 1-tailed two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests to perform group comparisons of all summary measures. We also report Cliff's delta effect size (Cliff, 1993) for every hypothesis test.\nLocation: Elad2021.pdf.md:103-139",
    "key_findings_brief": "Answer: Complete distributions of z-score deviations across multiple white matter ROIs and imaging measures (FA, FAt, FW) improved binary classification (best AUC = 0.726 using FAt+FW) compared to individual ROI values, but extreme deviations (abnormal z-scores) were rare and provided limited predictive value, suggesting schizophrenia is characterized by subtle, distributed white matter abnormalities rather than severe focal lesions.\nConfidence Rating: High\nNegative Answer Category: Not Negative\nReason: This summary captures the key findings reported in the Results and Discussion sections.\nSupporting Text: Our key finding is that the use of the complete distribution of deviations from the normative range of each individual as an input to a binary classifier improves the predictive performance for all tested measures (FA, FAt, FW). [...] We also find that extreme deviations from the normative model are not found in a sufficient number of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, and, accordingly, summary measures based on extreme deviations are less efficient diagnostic measures. [...] The highest score (AUC = 0.726) was achieved when inputting together all the z -scores of all ROIs for both the FAt and the FW measures into the classifier\nLocation: Elad2021.pdf.md:201-207",
    "key_findings_detailed": "Answer: Group-level analyses showed significantly lower FA/FAt and higher FW in schizophrenia across most ROIs, with larger effect sizes for z-scores than raw values (p<.001). Only 10.3% of SCZ individuals (62/601) had at least one infra-normal FA ROI (vs. 7.2% of controls, 37/512), with Forceps major most frequently affected (19/601, 3.16%). Individual ROI z-scores yielded low-to-moderate classification performance (best single ROI: WM skeleton AUC=0.64 for FA; Forceps major AUC=0.627). Combining z-scores across all 18 ROIs improved prediction: FA AUC=0.67, FAt AUC=0.68, FW AUC=0.70, FAt+FW AUC=0.726. The z-score range significantly discriminating SCZ from controls (-3.36 < z < -0.6 for FA) largely fell within the 'normal' range (|z| < 2.99), indicating that extreme deviations are not characteristic of schizophrenia. Summary measures (load, severity) had smaller effect sizes than individual tract z-scores. Free-water measures (FAt, FW) outperformed standard FA, and combining both measures achieved the best performance, suggesting multiple pathological processes. Sex-stratified analyses revealed differential patterns: males showed better prediction with FAt (AUC=0.696) than FW (AUC=0.664), while females showed the opposite (FAt AUC=0.661, FW AUC=0.771). These findings indicate schizophrenia involves subtle, heterogeneous, and spatially distributed white matter abnormalities rather than severe focal lesions.\nConfidence Rating: High\nNegative Answer Category: Not Negative\nReason: This detailed summary integrates key numerical findings from the Results section and author interpretations from the Discussion.\nSupporting Text: Multiple passages from Results section (lines 153-203) and Discussion section (lines 205-231)\nLocation: Elad2021.pdf.md:153-231",
    "key_limitations": "Answer: Retrospectively harmonized data not acquired with state-of-the-art multi-shell protocols; data heterogeneity regarding treatment protocols and comorbid substance use not accounted for; heterogeneous schizophrenia cohort across multiple illness stages may not be optimal for identifying predictive clinical features; no investigation of relationship between clinical symptoms and brain abnormalities; specificity of findings to schizophrenia vs. other psychotic disorders not tested; modest classification performance (AUC=0.726) indicates 'acceptable' but not excellent discrimination.\nConfidence Rating: High\nNegative Answer Category: Not Negative\nReason: The authors explicitly discuss multiple limitations in the final paragraphs of the Discussion section.\nSupporting Text: This study nonetheless has several limitations. First, since the dMRI data from this study were retrospectively harmonized, they were not acquired with state-of-the-art acquisition protocols. A more current protocol with multiple b -value shells and better image resolution would improve the accuracy of the bi-tensor model fit (Pasternak, Shenton, &amp; Westin, 2012). Second, the analysis we performed did not account for the data heterogeneity in the context of different treatment protocols and different comorbid substance use/abuse, which may serve as possible confounders of our results. [...] We note that previous studies showed that the type and extent of FAt and FW abnormalities depend on age, and on the stage of the disorder [...] Therefore, the current data, that are heterogeneous in terms of disorder stage, may not be optimal for the identification of predictive clinical features. [...] In addition, as previous studies (Hill et al., 2013; Reininghaus et al., 2019; Skudlarski et al., 2013; Tamminga et al., 2013) show that the abnormality pattern observed in schizophrenia overlaps with the abnormality pattern observed in other psychotic disorders, it is a matter of future research to test the specificity of our findings to schizophrenia. Lastly, investigating the relationship between clinical symptoms and the brain abnormalities found is beyond the scope of the current article\nLocation: Elad2021.pdf.md:228-230",
    "application_notes": "Answer: Study demonstrates that normative modeling can improve subject-level predictions when combined with machine learning classification, but achieving clinical utility requires: (1) using complete z-score distributions rather than only extreme deviations, (2) combining multiple imaging measures (FAt + FW), (3) integrating information across multiple brain regions, and (4) accounting for sex differences. Authors suggest future improvements through: more elaborate dMRI models, inclusion of clinical phenotypes and structural measures, more clinically homogeneous cohorts, investigation of symptom-brain relationships, and testing in other psychotic disorders to establish diagnostic specificity.\nConfidence Rating: High\nNegative Answer Category: Not Negative\nReason: The Discussion section provides extensive commentary on practical implications and future directions for applying normative modeling to schizophrenia.\nSupporting Text: Our findings show that the combination of multiple imaging features increases the predictive performance of the model. This suggests that it would be beneficial to include additional measures of interest, for example, more elaborate dMRI models, clinical phenotypes, or volumetric/cortical thickness measures, and develop more elaborate normative models that combine information from more than one feature at a time, to further improve prediction performance. [...] Availability of clinical parameters may also generalize our approaches to the prediction of other properties, such as clinical outcome, or treatment response. We anticipate that using normative models will improve performance of such prediction models as well.\nLocation: Elad2021.pdf.md:225"

Key methodological innovations include: (1) nonparametric age adjustment via Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with cross-validation-based bandwidth selection, (2) sex stratification rather than covariate adjustment, (3) comprehensive comparison of standard (FA) vs. advanced free-water (FAt, FW) dMRI measures, and (4) systematic evaluation of different feature representations (individual ROI values, combined ROI vectors, summary statistics, complete z-distributions). The study provides important negative findings: extreme deviations (|z| > 2.999) were rare in SCZ and provided limited diagnostic value, challenging common assumptions about normative modeling. Instead, the discriminative z-range largely fell within what is conventionally considered 'normal' (|z| < 2.99), highlighting that schizophrenia pathology involves subtle, distributed abnormalities. The authors explicitly acknowledge not expecting dMRI-based classification to match clinical diagnostic accuracy, as schizophrenia diagnosis relies on clinical symptom assessment. Ridge regularization was used to prevent overfitting in the high-dimensional feature space. The dataset leverages prior retrospective harmonization work (Karayumak et al., 2019; Ning et al., 2020) and builds on previous findings from the same cohort (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020 for group-level white matter abnormalities; Seitz et al., 2020 for sex effects). Algorithm 1 provides pseudocode for the z-score calculation procedure.
