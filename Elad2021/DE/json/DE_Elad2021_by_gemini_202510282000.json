While extreme deviations were not highly predictive, combining the full range of z-scores across multiple white matter tracts and multiple dMRI measures (FA, FAt, and FW) yielded the best classification performance (AUC = 0.726). This suggests that schizophrenia is characterized by subtle, distributed white matter abnormalities rather than large focal ones.",
    "key_limitations": "The study's limitations include the use of retrospectively harmonized data from non-state-of-the-art acquisition protocols, the lack of accounting for treatment and comorbidity heterogeneity, the need to test for specificity against other psychotic disorders, and the absence of an investigation into the relationship between brain abnormalities and clinical symptoms.",
    "application_notes": "The authors suggest that their findings can serve as an early step in the development of a classification scheme that involves schizophrenia and therefore aid in subject-level classification. They also propose that including additional measures and developing more elaborate normative models could further improve prediction performance."
