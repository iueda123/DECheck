#### Site Effect Handling
- **Answer**: Batch-removal
- **Confidence Rating**: High

(2020); Performance evaluated by unpaired t-tests on matched controls across sites; scanner-related differences were removed after harmonization while preserving true variability related to the disorder (e.g., age, sex, clinical population differences).
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper provides clear description of the harmonization approach and its evaluation, with references to the specific harmonization methods used.
- **Supporting Text**: The single shell dMRI data followed a standardized preprocessing protocol and were harmonized across sites to remove site-related differences using retrospective harmonization (Karayumak et al., 2019; Ning et al., 2020). In particular, Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of the harmonization procedure by using unpaired t tests to assess between-site differences and showed that statistical differences between matched controls across sites were removed after harmonization (see Figure S2 in Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020). We note that following the harmonization, site differences between subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia are likely to occur, because of different distributions across sites of parameters such as age, sex, and type of clinical populations. These differences are important to be preserved, as they reflect true variability related to the disorder, while scanner related differences are removed.

## Normative Modeling

#### Model Origin
- **Answer**: New
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper describes constructing a new normative model from the healthy controls in the current dataset using Nadaraya-Watson estimators.
- **Supporting Text**: The normative model represents the distribution of the normative range within each ROI in the healthy controls using the sample mean and standard deviation. To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964) with a Gaussian kernel
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:73

#### Model Origin Detail
- **Answer**: -
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Model origin is 'New', so this field is not applicable.
- **Supporting Text**: N/A
- **Location**: N/A

#### Modeling Method
- **Answer**: Nadaraya-Watson (NW) nonparametric kernel regression with Gaussian kernel
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper explicitly describes using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with a Gaussian kernel for age-specific weighted mean and standard deviation.
- **Supporting Text**: To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964) with a Gaussian kernel
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:73

#### Software Tool
- **Answer**: Custom implementation (Nadaraya-Watson estimator with cross-validation for bandwidth selection)
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper describes implementing the NW estimator with custom cross-validation for bandwidth selection, but does not specify a particular software package.
- **Supporting Text**: To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964) with a Gaussian kernel [...] To set h for every ROI, and every dMRI modality (FA, FAt, or FW), we minimized the cross-validation function
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:73-82

#### Response Variable
- **Answer**: FA (Fractional Anisotropy); FAt (Free-water corrected Fractional Anisotropy of tissue compartment); FW (Free-water fractional volume)
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper analyzes three dMRI measures as response variables: FA, FAt (tissue FA from free-water model), and FW (free-water fraction).
- **Supporting Text**: The harmonized data were fitted using FSL's DTIFIT (Behrens et al., 2003) to the DTI model, from which FA was derived. The data were also fitted to the two-compartments Free-water imaging model (including a free-water compartment and a tissue compartment) using a regularized nonlinear fit (Pasternak et al., 2009). In this process, the fractional volume of the free-water compartment (FW) as well as the FA of the tissue compartment (FAt) were estimated
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:66-67

#### Predictor Variables
- **Answer**: Age; Sex
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The normative model explicitly controls for age and sex as covariates. Age is modeled continuously via kernel weighting, and sex is handled by stratification (sex-specific models).
- **Supporting Text**: To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964) with a Gaussian kernel
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:73

#### Predictor Effects
- **Answer**: Age: continuous nonparametric effect (kernel-weighted); Sex: stratified (separate models for males and females)
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper describes a nonparametric age adjustment via kernel weighting, and sex is handled by estimating separate normative models for each sex rather than including sex as a covariate.
- **Supporting Text**: To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964) with a Gaussian kernel [...] where x is the patient age and n is the size of the sex-matched control group.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:73-76

#### NM Vldtn Handle NS
- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The normative model explicitly handles nuisance structure by: (1) nonparametrically adjusting for age-related nonlinearity via kernel weighting, (2) stratifying by sex to handle sex differences, and (3) estimating both mean and variance (heteroscedasticity) as functions of age. Site effects were removed via retrospective harmonization prior to modeling. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach for bandwidth selection also helps control model uncertainty.
- **Supporting Text**: To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator [...] The procedure therefore guarantees that we select the bandwidth for which the weighted mean c mh best reflects the normative range. [...] The single shell dMRI data followed a standardized preprocessing protocol and were harmonized across sites to remove site-related differences using retrospective harmonization
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:61, 73-89

#### NM Vldtn Same Domain Nonindep
- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper validates the normative model using leave-one-out cross-validation within the healthy control group. Each control subject is compared to a normative model built from all other controls (excluding that subject). This provides same-domain non-independent validation, as the validation data come from the same cohort used for training.
- **Supporting Text**: The same procedure was also used to evaluate deviation of each healthy control subject, but with a leave-one-out approach, that is, we compared a given healthy control subject with a normative model composed of all healthy control subjects, excluding the one being evaluated. [...] To set h for every ROI, and every dMRI modality (FA, FAt, or FW), we minimized the cross-validation function, [...] where d mh , /C0 j is the leave-one-out-estimator
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:82-97

#### NM Vldtn Same Domain Indep
- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The paper does not report validation on an independent held-out set of healthy controls from the same domain. The only validation within healthy controls is leave-one-out cross-validation, which is non-independent. No separate independent HC test set is described.
- **Supporting Text**: N/A - No independent same-domain validation set is mentioned
- **Location**: N/A

#### NM Vldtn Diff Domain
- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The paper does not report validation on data from a different domain (e.g., different scanner, site, or cohort not included in the original 13-site dataset). All analyses are performed on the single harmonized multi-site dataset.
- **Supporting Text**: N/A - No different-domain validation is mentioned
- **Location**: N/A

#### Deviation Metric
- **Answer**: Z-score (age- and sex-adjusted); abnormality threshold |z| > 2.999 (Bonferroni-corrected p < .05 for 18 tests); infra-normal (z < -2.999) and supra-normal (z > 2.999) classifications; summary measures including load (fraction of abnormal ROIs), severity (largest absolute z-score), average z-score, standard deviation of z-scores, fraction in significant range
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper provides detailed description of how deviations were quantified, including the threshold for abnormality and various summary measures.
- **Supporting Text**: The deviation of every individual diagnosed with schizophrenia from the normative atlas, in each ROI, was captured by a z -score, calculated using the NW estimators [...] The z -scores were truncated to the range /C0 10,10 [...] To define abnormal z -scores we used the threshold of j z j &gt; 2.999, corresponding to p &lt; .05 Bonferroni corrected for 18 tests (for 18 ROIs). ROIs with z -scores above 2.999 were defined as supra-normal, ROIs with z -scores below /C0 2.999 were defined as infra-normal. [...] The summary measures included: fraction of abnormal ROIs (also called ' load ' [Bouix et al., 2013]), z -score with the largest absolute value (also called ' severity ' [Bouix et al., 2013]), average z -score, standard-deviation of z -scores and fraction of ROIs having z -scores in the significant range
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md:93-113

- **Association Analysis**: Answer: Binary classification using logistic regression with ridge regularization; 10-fold cross-validation; predictive performance measured by area under receiver operator curve (AUC); group comparisons using 1-tailed Welch's t-tests (for raw values and z-scores) with Cohen's d effect sizes; 1-tailed two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes (for summary measures and distributions); sex-stratified analyses performed separately for males and females
Confidence Rating: High
Negative Answer Category: Not Negative
Reason: The paper provides comprehensive description of statistical methods used to link deviations to clinical group membership, including both group-level comparisons and subject-level classification.
Supporting Text: We examined the diagnostic potential of the normative modeling approach by using the z -score maps, as well as the z -score derived measures, as inputs to a binary classifier [...] We chose logistic regression with ridge regularization (McIlhagga, 2016) as the binary classifier of choice [...] Prediction performance of the estimated models was validated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. [...] The average of the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), across the 10 test sets, was the evaluation metric. [...] Group comparisons of raw dMRI values (i.e., the FA, FAt and FW values before the construction of the normative model) and z -score values (for FA, FAt and FW) of all subjects in each ROI were performed using 1-tailed Welch's t tests (Welch, 1951) [...] We also report Cohen's d effect size (Cohen, 2013) for every hypothesis test. [...] we used 1-tailed two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests to perform group comparisons of all summary measures. We also report Cliff's delta effect size (Cliff, 1993) for every hypothesis test.
Location: Elad2021.pdf.md:103-139
- **Key Findings Brief**: Answer: Complete distributions of z-score deviations across multiple white matter ROIs and imaging measures (FA, FAt, FW) improved binary classification (best AUC = 0.726 using FAt+FW) compared to individual ROI values, but extreme deviations (abnormal z-scores) were rare and provided limited predictive value, suggesting schizophrenia is characterized by subtle, distributed white matter abnormalities rather than severe focal lesions.
Confidence Rating: High
Negative Answer Category: Not Negative
Reason: This summary captures the key findings reported in the Results and Discussion sections.
Supporting Text: Our key finding is that the use of the complete distribution of deviations from the normative range of each individual as an input to a binary classifier improves the predictive performance for all tested measures (FA, FAt, FW). [...] We also find that extreme deviations from the normative model are not found in a sufficient number of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, and, accordingly, summary measures based on extreme deviations are less efficient diagnostic measures. [...] The highest score (AUC = 0.726) was achieved when inputting together all the z -scores of all ROIs for both the FAt and the FW measures into the classifier
Location: Elad2021.pdf.md:201-207
- **Key Findings Detailed**: Answer: Group-level analyses showed significantly lower FA/FAt and higher FW in schizophrenia across most ROIs, with larger effect sizes for z-scores than raw values (p<.001). Only 10.3% of SCZ individuals (62/601) had at least one infra-normal FA ROI (vs. 7.2% of controls, 37/512), with Forceps major most frequently affected (19/601, 3.16%). Individual ROI z-scores yielded low-to-moderate classification performance (best single ROI: WM skeleton AUC=0.64 for FA; Forceps major AUC=0.627). Combining z-scores across all 18 ROIs improved prediction: FA AUC=0.67, FAt AUC=0.68, FW AUC=0.70, FAt+FW AUC=0.726. The z-score range significantly discriminating SCZ from controls (-3.36 < z < -0.6 for FA) largely fell within the 'normal' range (|z| < 2.99), indicating that extreme deviations are not characteristic of schizophrenia. Summary measures (load, severity) had smaller effect sizes than individual tract z-scores. Free-water measures (FAt, FW) outperformed standard FA, and combining both measures achieved the best performance, suggesting multiple pathological processes. Sex-stratified analyses revealed differential patterns: males showed better prediction with FAt (AUC=0.696) than FW (AUC=0.664), while females showed the opposite (FAt AUC=0.661, FW AUC=0.771). These findings indicate schizophrenia involves subtle, heterogeneous, and spatially distributed white matter abnormalities rather than severe focal lesions.

Supporting Text: Multiple passages from Results section (lines 153-203) and Discussion section (lines 205-231)
Location: Elad2021.pdf.md:153-231
- **Key Limitations**: Answer: Retrospectively harmonized data not acquired with state-of-the-art multi-shell protocols; data heterogeneity regarding treatment protocols and comorbid substance use not accounted for; heterogeneous schizophrenia cohort across multiple illness stages may not be optimal for identifying predictive clinical features; no investigation of relationship between clinical symptoms and brain abnormalities; specificity of findings to schizophrenia vs. other psychotic disorders not tested; modest classification performance (AUC=0.726) indicates 'acceptable' but not excellent discrimination.
Confidence Rating: High
Negative Answer Category: Not Negative
Reason: The authors explicitly discuss multiple limitations in the final paragraphs of the Discussion section.
Supporting Text: This study nonetheless has several limitations. First, since the dMRI data from this study were retrospectively harmonized, they were not acquired with state-of-the-art acquisition protocols. A more current protocol with multiple b -value shells and better image resolution would improve the accuracy of the bi-tensor model fit (Pasternak, Shenton, &amp; Westin, 2012). Second, the analysis we performed did not account for the data heterogeneity in the context of different treatment protocols and different comorbid substance use/abuse, which may serve as possible confounders of our results. [...] We note that previous studies showed that the type and extent of FAt and FW abnormalities depend on age, and on the stage of the disorder [...] Therefore, the current data, that are heterogeneous in terms of disorder stage, may not be optimal for the identification of predictive clinical features. [...] In addition, as previous studies (Hill et al., 2013; Reininghaus et al., 2019; Skudlarski et al., 2013; Tamminga et al., 2013) show that the abnormality pattern observed in schizophrenia overlaps with the abnormality pattern observed in other psychotic disorders, it is a matter of future research to test the specificity of our findings to schizophrenia. Lastly, investigating the relationship between clinical symptoms and the brain abnormalities found is beyond the scope of the current article
Location: Elad2021.pdf.md:228-230
- **Application Notes**: Answer: Study demonstrates that normative modeling can improve subject-level predictions when combined with machine learning classification, but achieving clinical utility requires: (1) using complete z-score distributions rather than only extreme deviations, (2) combining multiple imaging measures (FAt + FW), (3) integrating information across multiple brain regions, and (4) accounting for sex differences. Authors suggest future improvements through: more elaborate dMRI models, inclusion of clinical phenotypes and structural measures, more clinically homogeneous cohorts, investigation of symptom-brain relationships, and testing in other psychotic disorders to establish diagnostic specificity.
Confidence Rating: High
Negative Answer Category: Not Negative
Reason: The Discussion section provides extensive commentary on practical implications and future directions for applying normative modeling to schizophrenia.
Supporting Text: Our findings show that the combination of multiple imaging features increases the predictive performance of the model. This suggests that it would be beneficial to include additional measures of interest, for example, more elaborate dMRI models, clinical phenotypes, or volumetric/cortical thickness measures, and develop more elaborate normative models that combine information from more than one feature at a time, to further improve prediction performance. [...] Availability of clinical parameters may also generalize our approaches to the prediction of other properties, such as clinical outcome, or treatment response. We anticipate that using normative models will improve performance of such prediction models as well.

NONCANONICAL_DATA:
- general_notes.Answer: "This study represents an important methodological contribution by systematically comparing normative modeling features (z-scores) with raw dMRI values for subject-level classification in schizophrenia. Key methodological innovations include: (1) nonparametric age adjustment via Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with cross-validation-based bandwidth selection, (2) sex stratification rather than covariate adjustment, (3) comprehensive comparison of standard (FA) vs. advanced free-water (FAt, FW) dMRI measures, and (4) systematic evaluation of different feature representations (individual ROI values, combined ROI vectors, summary statistics, complete z-distributions). The study provides important negative findings: extreme deviations (|z| > 2.999) were rare in SCZ and provided limited diagnostic value, challenging common assumptions about normative modeling. Instead, the discriminative z-range largely fell within what is conventionally considered 'normal' (|z| < 2.99), highlighting that schizophrenia pathology involves subtle, distributed abnormalities. The authors explicitly acknowledge not expecting dMRI-based classification to match clinical diagnostic accuracy, as schizophrenia diagnosis relies on clinical symptom assessment. Ridge regularization was used to prevent overfitting in the high-dimensional feature space. The dataset leverages prior retrospective harmonization work (Karayumak et al., 2019; Ning et al., 2020) and builds on previous findings from the same cohort (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020 for group-level white matter abnormalities; Seitz et al., 2020 for sex effects). Algorithm 1 provides pseudocode for the z-score calculation procedure. Supplementary materials include chosen bandwidths for each ROI/modality combination, detailed statistical results tables, and additional figures. All 13 contributing sites are acknowledged in the funding section with specific NIH grant numbers."
