- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper describes the use of z-scores to quantify deviation.
- **Supporting Text**: The deviation of every individual diagnosed with schizophrenia from the normative atlas, in each ROI, was captured by a z -score
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, line 183

- **Association Analysis**: The study used Welch's t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for group comparisons, and logistic regression with ridge regularization for prediction modeling. The performance of the prediction models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC).
- **Key Findings Brief**: The use of the complete distribution of deviations from the normative range of each individual as an input to a binary classifier improves the predictive performance for all tested measures (FA, FAt, FW).
- **Key Findings Detailed**: The study found that using the complete distribution of deviations from a normative model improves subject-level classification of schizophrenia from dMRI data. While extreme deviations were not highly predictive, combining the full range of z-scores across multiple white matter tracts and multiple dMRI measures (FA, FAt, and FW) yielded the best classification performance (AUC = 0.726). This suggests that schizophrenia is characterized by subtle, distributed white matter abnormalities rather than large focal ones.
- **Key Limitations**: The study's limitations include the use of retrospectively harmonized data from non-state-of-the-art acquisition protocols, the lack of accounting for treatment and comorbidity heterogeneity, the need to test for specificity against other psychotic disorders, and the absence of an investigation into the relationship between brain abnormalities and clinical symptoms.
- **Application Notes**: The authors suggest that their findings can serve as an early step in the development of a classification scheme that involves schizophrenia and therefore aid in subject-level classification. They also propose that including additional measures and developing more elaborate normative models could further improve prediction performance.

## General Notes

**General Notes**: The paper provides a thorough investigation of the predictive potential of normative modeling in schizophrenia using a large, multi-site dMRI dataset. The use of both standard and advanced dMRI measures, as well as the comparison of different feature sets for classification, are notable strengths of the study.
