- **Supporting Text**: ...includes 601 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder ... and 512 healthy controls ... dMRI data were collated from 13 different sites...
- **Location**: materials/Elad2021.pdf.md L61

#### Diseases Studied

- **Location**: materials/Elad2021.pdf.md L61

#### Clinical Groups Sex
- **Answer**: Schizophrenia-spectrum: F 221 (36.77%); M 380 (63.23%)
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Male count/percent provided; female computed by subtraction.
- **Supporting Text**: 380 [63.23%] male
- **Location**: materials/Elad2021.pdf.md L61

#### Deviation Metric
- **Answer**: ROI-wise z-scores (age/sex-adjusted); extreme deviation threshold |z| > 2.999 (Bonferroni for 18 ROIs); fraction in significant z-score range from z-distribution analysis
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Paper defines z-score computation and thresholds and derives a significant z-score range via PDF comparisons.
- **Supporting Text**: The deviation ... captured by a z-score ... To define abnormal z-scores we used the threshold of |z| > 2.999 ... testing what range of FA z-scores best discriminates ... identified the range of -3.36 < z < -0.6 ...
- **Location**: materials/Elad2021.pdf.md L91-L99; L106-L110; L169-L171

- **Association Analysis**: Group comparisons with one-tailed Welch's t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum on raw and z values; classification via ridge logistic regression with 10-fold CV reporting AUC; summary measures (load, severity, mean, SD, fraction in significant range) compared with Cliff's delta.
- **Key Findings Brief**: Using complete distributions of deviation z-scores across ROIs improves schizophrenia classification over single-ROI features; combining FAt and FW z-scores achieved the best AUC (~0.73).
- **Key Findings Detailed**: Z-scores across all ROIs improved AUC over raw values (e.g., FA z-scores all-ROI AUC = 0.67). Across modalities, all-ROI z-scores yielded AUCs: FAt 0.68, FW 0.70; combining FAt+FW z-scores reached AUC = 0.726. For FA, significant discriminatory range was -3.36 < z < -0.6 (not limited to |z|>2.999). Abnormality rates: FA infra-normal in ≥1 ROI: SZ 62/601 (10.3%) vs HC 37/512 (7.2%); FAt infra-normal: SZ 87/601 (14.47%) vs HC 38/512 (7.42%); FW supra-normal: SZ 84/601 (13.97%) vs HC 35/512 (6.8%). Summary measures showed significant group differences (e.g., average z across ROIs p<.001; Cliff's delta=0.213).
- **Key Limitations**: External (different-domain) validation absent; AUC indicates only acceptable discrimination; extreme z-score abnormalities are rare; potential residual nuisance factors (e.g., motion/QC metrics) not explicitly modeled beyond harmonization and age/sex adjustment; ROI-level approach may miss voxelwise patterns.
- **Application Notes**: Sex-stratified normative models with age-specific NW smoothing; bandwidth via CV; z-distribution used to derive a data-driven significant range; logistic ridge used to reduce overfitting; emphasizes distributed, non-localized deviations in schizophrenia.
