Supplementary Table S1 Chosen bandwidth for each modality and ROI

Supplementary Table S2p‐values and Cohen's‐d effect sizes for a 1‐tailed t test searching for lower values in the schizophrenia patients group in FA and FAt modalities, and for higher values in the schizophrenia patients group in the FW modality. Significant values (p < .05) are marked in a bold font.

Supplementary Table S3 Fraction of individuals with abnormal z‐scores in each ROI (infra‐normal in FA, FAt and supra‐normal in FW)

Supplementary Figure S1 Effect sizes (in absolute values) obtained when testing for group differences in each of the summary measures, in FA (green bars), FAt (red bars), and FW (blue bars). The acronyms are identical to the ones used in Figure 2.
