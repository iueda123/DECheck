## Assessment Items - Group A

### 1. Clarity of Research Objectives

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The abstract and introduction clearly state the research objective, which is to evaluate whether normative modeling can improve subject-level predictions in schizophrenia using dMRI data. The PICO elements are identifiable: P (individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls), I (normative modeling of dMRI data), C (raw dMRI values), and O (subject-level classification performance).
- **Supporting Text**: Here, we leveraged a large harmonized diffusion MRI dataset from 512 healthy controls and 601 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, to study whether normative modeling can improve subject-level predictions from a binary classifier. In this article, we use a large sample of harmonized dMRI data (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020), comprised of 512 healthy controls and 601 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, to evaluate the predictive power of features derived from a normative modeling approach and compare it with the predictive power of raw dMRI values serving as features.

### 2. Clear Definition of Target Population

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The paper provides basic demographic information (age and sex) for both the schizophrenia and healthy control groups. However, it does not specify the diagnostic criteria used for schizophrenia, nor does it provide a detailed definition of the healthy control group. Instead, it refers to a previous publication (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020) for a complete account of demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- **Supporting Text**: The dataset used in this study coincides with the dataset utilized in the published work by (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020), which includes 601 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder across multiple illness stages (mean [SD] age, 31.46 [12.31] years; 380 [63.23%] male), and 512 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 30.15 [14.26] years; 279 [54.49%] male). ... A complete account of demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, acquisition protocols across the 13 sites, preprocessing and harmonization procedures can be found in Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020).
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 2, lines 123-130.

### 3. Clarity of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The paper explicitly states that the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in a different publication (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020). This information is not present in the Elad et al. 2021 paper itself.
- **Supporting Text**: A complete account of demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, acquisition protocols across the 13 sites, preprocessing and harmonization procedures can be found in Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020).
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 2, lines 128-130.

### 4. Validity of Normative Modeling Outcome Measures

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper clearly defines the brain measures used (FA, FAt, and FW in 18 white matter ROIs). It details the method for quantifying individual-level deviations using z-scores based on a normative model derived from the healthy control group. The characteristics of the normative reference population (healthy controls) are specified in terms of sample size, age, and sex. The interpretation of deviation scores (z-scores) is also clearly defined, with a specific threshold for abnormality.
- **Supporting Text**: The harmonized data were fitted using FSL's DTIFIT (Behrens et al., 2003) to the DTI model, from which FA was derived. The data were also fitted to the two-compartments Free-water imaging model... In this process, the fractional volume of the free-water compartment (FW) as well as the FA of the tissue compartment (FAt) were estimated... The deviation of every individual diagnosed with schizophrenia from the normative atlas, in each ROI, was captured by a z -score... To define abnormal z -scores we used the threshold of j z j > 2.999...

### 5. Handling of Confounding Variables

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper clearly describes the methods used to handle confounding variables. Age and sex were accounted for by creating sex-specific normative models with age-specific weighted means and standard deviations. Site effects were addressed using a retrospective harmonization method, and the paper refers to the publication where this harmonization was validated.
- **Supporting Text**: To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. The single shell dMRI data followed a standardized preprocessing protocol and were harmonized across sites to remove site-related differences using retrospective harmonization (Karayumak et al., 2019; Ning et al., 2020).
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 2, lines 150-152 and 126-128.

### 6. Clarity of Data Sources

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The paper states that the data were collated from 13 different sites and multiple studies, and explicitly names the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). However, it does not name the other 12 sites or studies, instead referring to a previous publication (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020) for complete details.
- **Supporting Text**: dMRI data were collated from 13 different sites across a number of separate studies. ... A complete account of demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, acquisition protocols across the 13 sites, preprocessing and harmonization procedures can be found in Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020). All data, except for the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) (Satterthwaite et al., 2014, 2016) were provided by the principal investigators...

### 7. Description of Image Acquisition Protocol

- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The paper does not describe the image acquisition protocols. It only provides the resolution and b-value of the data after harmonization and explicitly refers to a different publication (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020) for the complete acquisition protocols across the 13 sites.
- **Supporting Text**: A complete account of demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, acquisition protocols across the 13 sites, preprocessing and harmonization procedures can be found in Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020). Following harmonization, all data had isotropic resolution of 1.5 mm /C2 1.5 mm /C2 1.5 mm, with a b -value of 1,000 s/mm 2 .

## Assessment Items - Group B

### 1. Details of Data Preprocessing

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The paper mentions some of the software used for post-harmonization processing (FSL's DTIFIT, ANTs). However, it does not provide details of the main preprocessing pipeline, instead referring to a previous publication (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020) for the "standardized preprocessing protocol" and "harmonization procedures". Quality control procedures are not described.
- **Supporting Text**: The single shell dMRI data followed a standardized preprocessing protocol and were harmonized across sites... A complete account of... preprocessing and harmonization procedures can be found in Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020). The harmonized data were fitted using FSL's DTIFIT... The FA image of each subject was registered to the FA IIT template using ANTs registration...
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 2, lines 126-130, 137-145.

### 2. Clarity of Data Partitioning Methods

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper clearly describes the data partitioning method. It specifies a 10-fold cross-validation procedure and details the composition of each fold. It also explicitly mentions a measure to prevent data leakage: the normative model was estimated using only the training set in each fold.
- **Supporting Text**: Prediction performance of the estimated models was validated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The data were partitioned into 10 subsets... In each cross-validation round, one of the 10 subsets served as the test set, while the other 9 subsets served as the training set... We note that in each cross-validation, the normative range, as well as the choice of a bandwidth, were estimated using only the healthy control subjects that belonged to the corresponding training set. This guaranteed that the classification performance on the test sets was not biased by the estimated normative model.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 3, lines 219-228.

### 3. Details of Normative Modeling Approach

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper provides a detailed description of the normative modeling approach. It specifies the use of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with a Gaussian kernel to create age-specific and sex-specific normative models. It also details the hyperparameter (bandwidth 'h') and the method used to optimize it (leave-one-out cross-validation). The chosen bandwidths are reported in the supplementary material.
- **Supporting Text**: To control for confounding factors resulting from age and sex differences, we represented the normative range in each ROI by an age specific weighted mean, c mh , and standard deviation, b σ 2 h , for each sex separately. To do so, we used the NadarayaWatson (NW) estimator (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964) with a Gaussian kernel... h >0 is a bandwidth parameter. To set h for every ROI, and every dMRI modality (FA, FAt, or FW), we minimized the cross-validation function... The chosen bandwidths are reported in Table S1.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 2, lines 150-160.

### 4. Details of Training Algorithm

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The paper specifies the classification model used (logistic regression with ridge regularization). However, it does not provide any details about the training process itself. Key information is missing, including the optimization algorithm, how the regularization hyperparameter was selected, and the convergence criteria.
- **Supporting Text**: We chose logistic regression with ridge regularization (McIlhagga, 2016) as the binary classifier of choice, thus enforcing sparse and stable classification solutions.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 3, lines 216-218.

### 5. Model Performance Evaluation Metrics

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper clearly specifies the performance metrics used. For the classification models, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was the primary evaluation metric. For group comparisons, Welch's t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used, and Cohen's d and Cliff's delta were reported as effect sizes. The meaning of these metrics is standard in the field.
- **Supporting Text**: The average of the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), across the 10 test sets, was the evaluation metric. We also report Cohen's d effect size (Cohen, 2013) for every hypothesis test. We also report Cliff's delta effect size (Cliff, 1993) for every hypothesis test.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 3, line 224; page 2, line 182; page 2, line 199.

### 6. Implementation of Internal Validation

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper clearly describes the implementation of internal validation. A 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the classification models. The use of ridge regularization was explicitly mentioned as a measure to create stable solutions and prevent overfitting. Furthermore, the authors took care to prevent data leakage by estimating the normative model parameters only on the training data within each fold.
- **Supporting Text**: Prediction performance of the estimated models was validated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. ... We note that in each cross-validation, the normative range, as well as the choice of a bandwidth, were estimated using only the healthy control subjects that belonged to the corresponding training set. This guaranteed that the classification performance on the test sets was not biased by the estimated normative model. We chose logistic regression with ridge regularization (McIlhagga, 2016) as the binary classifier of choice, thus enforcing sparse and stable classification solutions.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 3, lines 219-228, 216-218.

### 7. External Data Validation

- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The paper does not mention the use of an independent external dataset to validate the models. The entire analysis, including the cross-validation, was performed on a single large dataset collated from 13 sites.
- **Supporting Text**: The absence of any mention of an external validation dataset. The "Prediction models" section only describes internal validation through cross-validation.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, throughout.

### 8. Description of Dataset Characteristics

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The paper provides the total sample size and basic demographic information (mean/SD of age, sex ratio) for the schizophrenia and healthy control groups. However, it lacks detailed clinical characteristics of the patient group (symptom severity, illness duration, medication status) and does not describe how missing data were handled. It refers to another paper (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020) for a "complete account of demographics".
- **Supporting Text**: The dataset used in this study coincides with the dataset utilized in the published work by (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020), which includes 601 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder across multiple illness stages (mean [SD] age, 31.46 [12.31] years; 380 [63.23%] male), and 512 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 30.15 [14.26] years; 279 [54.49%] male). ... A complete account of demographics... can be found in Cetin-Karayumak et al. (2020).
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 2, lines 123-130.

### 9. Performance Metrics and Statistical Uncertainty

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The paper reports point estimates for its key performance metrics (AUC, Cohen's d, Cliff's delta) and provides p-values for statistical significance. It also reports confidence intervals for the effect sizes (Cohen's d). However, it fails to report any measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals or standard deviation) for its primary classification performance metric, the AUC, reporting only the average AUC across cross-validation folds.
- **Supporting Text**: yielding an AUC of 0.67. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval for Cohen's d effect size.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 4, line 251 and page 3, Figure 2 caption.

### 10. Consideration for Reproducibility

- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The paper provides very limited information for reproducibility. It explicitly states that the research data are not shared. While it names some software tools (FSL, ANTs), it does not specify their versions. There is no mention of the availability of the analysis code or the trained models.
- **Supporting Text**: Research data are not shared.
- **Location**: Elad2021.pdf.md, page 7, line 338.

### 11. Interpretation Specific to Normative Modeling

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper provides a good interpretation of the results specific to normative modeling. It clearly explains that individual deviation scores (z-scores) are more powerful for prediction when the whole distribution is used, rather than just focusing on extreme outliers. It explicitly contrasts this with traditional case-control approaches and discusses the implications for understanding the heterogeneity of schizophrenia. The prospects for clinical application are discussed realistically, noting that the current performance is "acceptable" but could be improved.
- **Supporting Text**: Our key finding is that the use of the complete distribution of deviations from the normative range of each individual as an input to a binary classifier improves the predictive performance... We also find that extreme deviations from the normative model are not found in a sufficient number of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, and, accordingly, summary measures based on extreme deviations are less efficient diagnostic measures. ... Instead of focusing on summary measures of extreme z -scores, we find that the complete distribution of deviations, and their combined effect on a number of imaging measures provides a more solid basis for prediction algorithms...

## Additional Comments

**Additional Comments**: A major limitation of this paper is its heavy reliance on a previous publication (Cetin-Karayumak et al., 2020) for critical methodological details, including participant inclusion/exclusion criteria, image acquisition protocols, and data preprocessing. This makes it impossible to fully evaluate the study's quality based on this article alone. Furthermore, the authors explicitly state that the data and code are not available, which severely limits the reproducibility of the findings.
