We first generate a normative\nmodel by estimating age- and sex-adjusted z-scores from standard\n(FA) and advanced (Free-water) dMRI measures in 18 white matter\nregions of interest (ROIs). Then, for every subject, the predictive performance\nof the following features is calculated and compared with\nthe predictive performance of the raw dMRI values: (1) z-scores\nobtained by applying the normative modeling approach on FA values;\n(2) summary measures for the z-score distributions (Pasternak\net al., 2014); (3) z-scores and summary measures obtained by applying\nthe normative modeling approach on free-water imaging derived measures\n(Pasternak, Sochen, Gur, Intrator, & Assaf, 2009) rather\nthan on FA.",
