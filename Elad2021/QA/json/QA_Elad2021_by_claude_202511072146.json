Clinical thresholds and decision criteria are discussed: the study found that the \u0027significant range\u0027 for discrimination (-3.36\u003cz\u003c-0.6 for FA) only partially overlaps with the \u0027abnormal\u0027 threshold, with most discriminative values within the \u0027normal\u0027 range (|z|\u003c2.999). Differences and advantages compared to traditional case-control studies are extensively discussed: normative modeling allows for individual-level inferences and accounts for heterogeneity in abnormality location, unlike case-control approaches that assume consistent patterns. Prospects for clinical application are realistically discussed: authors acknowledge limitations (\u0027acceptable discrimination\u0027 level, not comparable to clinical diagnosis) while suggesting this could be \u0027an early step in the development of a classification scheme.\u0027",
      "supporting_text": "We also find that extreme deviations from the normative model are not found in a sufficient number of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, and, accordingly, summary measures based on extreme deviations are less efficient diagnostic measures. Indeed, the z-distribution analysis identified that the range of z-scores that best discriminates the individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia from controls is bounded and does not include the most extreme range of z-scores. [...] We emphasize that as the diagnosis of schizophrenia relies upon identifying several different combinations of clinical symptoms and behavioral signs through an interview with a medical specialist, we do not expect that combining the normative modeling approach with classification would yield a performance that is comparable to clinical diagnosis. Rather, our aim is to provide new information about white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia using the combination of the two approaches, which may be proven useful in the future design of classification schemes",

    "additional_comments": "This study represents a methodologically rigorous application of normative modeling to diffusion MRI in schizophrenia. Strengths include: (1) Large multi-site sample with robust harmonization procedures; (2) Clear mathematical framework with detailed algorithms; (3) Novel approach to age/sex adjustment using nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson estimator with leave-one-out bandwidth selection; (4) Comparison of multiple dMRI measures (FA, FAt, FW) demonstrating added value of free-water imaging; (5) Proper cross-validation preventing data leakage. Limitations acknowledged by authors include: lack of external validation, clinical heterogeneity not fully characterized, data not acquired with state-of-the-art protocols, no investigation of clinical symptom relationships. The study makes important contributions to understanding that (a) extreme deviations may not be optimal features for prediction, and (b) the complete distribution of subtle deviations across multiple regions and measures provides better characterization than thresholded abnormality counts. The finding that discriminative z-scores fall within the \u0027normal\u0027 range challenges conventional normative modeling interpretation. Sex differences in predictive features (FW more important in females, FAt in males) warrant further investigation."
