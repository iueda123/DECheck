The FA image of each subject was registered to the FA IIT template using ANTs registration...",

      "reason": "The paper clearly describes the data partitioning method. It specifies a 10-fold cross-validation procedure and details the composition of each fold. It also explicitly mentions a measure to prevent data leakage: the normative model was estimated using only the training set in each fold.",
      "supporting_text": "Prediction performance of the estimated models was validated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The data were partitioned into 10 subsets... In each cross-validation round, one of the 10 subsets served as the test set, while the other 9 subsets served as the training set... We note that in each cross-validation, the normative range, as well as the choice of a bandwidth, were estimated using only the healthy control subjects that belonged to the corresponding training set. This guaranteed that the classification performance on the test sets was not biased by the estimated normative model.",
