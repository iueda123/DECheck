Results summary: 'Overall, autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume that was localized to the superior temporal cortex, whereas individuals with ADHD showed more global increases in cortical thickness but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The co-occurring autism + ADHD group showed a unique pattern of widespread increases in cortical thickness and certain decreases in surface area.

    "key_findings_detailed": "Answer: Robust neuroanatomical signatures were observed for both autism and ADHD benchmarked against BrainCharts normative models. Autistic individuals showed significantly greater ventricular volume centiles (d=0.150, p<.0001) and localized increases in superior temporal gyrus (STG) cortical thickness (CT; d=0.13-0.15) and volume (CV; d=0.13-0.15), but no surface area (SA) differences. ADHD showed significantly lower total cortical and subcortical gray matter volume (GMV d=-0.139, sGMV d=-0.132), white matter volume (WMV d=-0.156), and total SA (d=-0.178) centiles, but greater mean CT centiles (d=0.089) than controls. Regionally, ADHD showed widespread decreases in CV (d=-0.07 to -0.18) and SA (d=-0.07 to -0.18) but increases in CT (d=0.09-0.10) across most cortical regions. Effect sizes were relatively small. The co-occurring autism+ADHD group (n=203) showed a distinct profile with widespread significant increases in CT (d=0.10-0.24) and decreased SA in frontal/parietal regions (d=-0.11 to -0.14), resembling ADHD more than autism-only. Sex significantly modulated autism effects: males showed STG increases while females showed fusiform gyrus SA decreases (d=-0.18); no sex interaction for ADHD. Age-by-diagnosis interactions were limited: autism showed interaction only in superior frontal CT; ADHD showed interactions primarily in frontal/parietal CT with age correlations (partial r=0.07-0.14). Controlling for global measures drastically altered ADHD results but not autism, indicating ADHD effects were largely driven by global changes. Multimodal distributions of centiles were observed across most cortex for autism but not ADHD or controls. Dimensional analyses revealed limited significant but weak associations between neuroanatomy and clinical measures (ADOS CSS, RBS-R, SRS, SWAN).\nConfidence Rating: High\nNegative Answer Category: Not Negative\nReason: Results section provides comprehensive numerical details including effect sizes, p-values, and specific brain regions for all main findings.

Discussion synthesizes: 'Using an aggregated dataset and existing models of brain development, we observed largely distinct, robust neuroanatomical signatures of autism and ADHD ... Both conditions presented with greater CT ... localized to the STG in autism but widespread in ADHD. In contrast, while autistic individuals also showed STG increases in CV, ADHD was associated with globally decreased CV and SA.'\nLocation: Bedford2025.pdf.md: 85-145, Tables/Figures throughout",
    "key_limitations": "Answer: Multiple data sources with different scanners, protocols, recruitment procedures, and demographics create heterogeneity that cannot be fully eliminated despite harmonization efforts; Effect sizes were very small and may have limited clinical/practical significance; Out-of-sample centiles generated despite some overlap with original BrainCharts to account for site differences (smaller sites could lead to overestimation); Hemispheric averaging due to model availability may miss atypical asymmetry effects known in autism/ADHD; Lack of consistent phenotypic and diagnostic information limited clinical measure and co-occurring diagnosis analyses; IQ not controlled (partially due to data availability and concerns about removing biological variation); Sample representativeness issues: large male/female imbalance, lack of participants with lower IQ/high support needs, insufficient racial-ethnic diversity; Lack of longitudinal data limits conclusions about developmental trajectories over time.\nConfidence Rating: High\nNegative Answer Category: Not Negative\nReason: The discussion section includes a comprehensive limitations paragraph covering data heterogeneity, effect sizes, methodological constraints, phenotypic data availability, sample composition, and study design.\nSupporting Text: Discussion limitations: 'Our results should be interpreted in light of some limitations. First ... the data come from multiple sources, with different scanners, protocols, recruitment procedures, and demographic characteristics ... the effect sizes observed in most analyses were very small and thus may have limited clinical or practical significance ... out-of-sample centiles were generated for our dataset, despite some of these being included in the original BrainCharts models ... in smaller sites could lead to overestimation of effects. Second, due to the availability of the models, cortical measures were averaged across hemispheres. Both autism and ADHD have been associated with atypical asymmetry ... Third, the lack of consistent phenotypic and diagnostic information led to limited data in the analyses of clinical measures and co-occurring diagnoses ... we also did not investigate relationships with IQ ... Fourth, despite its large size, the representativeness of the sample is still suboptimal. There is still a large imbalance ... lack of participants with lower IQ and/or high support needs, and insufficient diversity across racial-ethnic groups. Finally, the lack of longitudinal data limits our ability to draw conclusions about developmental trajectories'.\nLocation: Bedford2025.pdf.md: 193-196",
    "application_notes": "Answer: Two-step harmonization approach: ComBat by site with age/sex/diagnosis covariates, then out-of-sample BrainCharts GAMLSS centile estimation. Rigorous QC: FSQC manual threshold (2.5) plus Euler covariate, with sensitivity analyses using multiple QC strategies. Spin permutation tests to control for spatial autocorrelation when comparing brain maps. Extensive sensitivity analyses including: controlling for global measures (GMV, SA, mean CT), different QC methods, sex-matched subsamples, ComBat vs non-ComBat harmonization, in-sample vs out-of-sample centiles. Regional overlap analysis of extreme deviations (>99th or <1st centile) to characterize individual variability. Multimodality testing using Hartigan's dip test to assess potential subgroups. Study treated ABIDE/ADHD200 sites individually rather than as combined datasets for proper site correction, and merged POND sites post-ComBat due to lack of controls at some sites. Hemispheric averaging was necessary due to BrainCharts model availability but may miss asymmetry effects.

    "general_notes": "Subcortical structures and cerebellum: Normative models were not available at the time of analysis, so these regions were not examined. Future work should extend to subcortex/cerebellum given known alterations in autism/ADHD. Hemisphere-specific models: Not available from BrainCharts at analysis time, requiring hemispheric averaging despite known asymmetry effects in both conditions. Sample overlap with BrainCharts: Some datasets (ABIDE, ADHD200) were in original BrainCharts training, but out-of-sample centiles computed here to enable proper site-level correction. Correlations between out-of-sample and original in-sample centiles for ABIDE were high (GMV r=0.88; WMV r=0.91; sGMV r=0.93; ventricular volume r=0.97), slightly lower than leave-one-study-out r~0.99 in original paper due to treating individual ABIDE sites separately. Robustness: Original BrainCharts work showed N>100 adequate for stable out-of-sample estimation. Full dataset list: 7 main datasets across 49 sites included ABIDE I (24 sites), ABIDE II (19 sites), ADHD200 (8 sites), POND (3 sites, merged post-ComBat), HBN/CMI (3 sites), Female ASD (6 sites from 4 centers, some split by scanner), UCSD (1 site), UK MRC-AIMS Cambridge (1 site). IQ data: Available for subsets; weak correlations with centiles (GMV/WMV/SA rho=0.12-0.14); not controlled due to collinearity with diagnosis, differing measures across sites, and concerns about removing biological variation. Secondary diagnoses: Not consistently available; autism+ADHD co-occurring group (n=203) likely underestimates true co-occurrence. Replication using SWAN cutoff (n=118) showed similar patterns. Consortium authorship: Paper includes MRC AIMS Consortium and Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium members listed in supplement/online. Ethical approval: Obtained for each primary study; Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics deemed secondary analysis of de-identified data did not require additional oversight (PRE.2020.104)."
