Individuals with ADHD showed more global increases in cortical thickness but lower cortical volume and surface area. The co-occurring autism+ADHD group showed widespread increases in cortical thickness and decreases in surface area. Sex modulated the neuroanatomy of autism but not ADHD, and there was an age-by-diagnosis interaction for ADHD only.",

Lack of consistent phenotypic and diagnostic information. The sample is not fully representative, with imbalances in sex, IQ, and racial-ethnic diversity. The study is cross-sectional.",
