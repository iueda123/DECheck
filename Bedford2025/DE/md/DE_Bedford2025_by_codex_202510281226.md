#### Deviation Metric
- **Answer**: Centile scores (0–1) from BrainCharts; extreme deviation defined using top/bottom 1% centiles (>0.99, <0.01) for overlap analyses.
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Centile scoring described in methods; extreme centile thresholds specified in the supplement.
- **Supporting Text**: Centile scores quantify variation in brain development and range from 0 to 1 ... We first identified individuals who had centile scores in the top or bottom percentile; i.e. a centile score of >0.99, or <0.01 ...
- **Location**: materials/Bedford2025.pdf.md: lines 69-75; materials/1-s2.0-S0006322324015130-mmc2.pdf.md: lines 375-376

- **Association Analysis**: Multiple linear regressions on centile scores with covariates (age, Euler number); FDR correction for multiple comparisons; spin permutation tests for spatial correlations of effect maps; additional analyses include sex-stratified effects, age-by-diagnosis interactions, and correlations/overlap in regions with extreme deviations.
- **Key Findings Brief**: Autism and ADHD show distinct cortical patterns: autism with localized increases (notably superior temporal), ADHD with more global CT increases but lower volume and surface area; co-occurring autism+ADHD shows a unique mixed profile; sex modulates autism effects but not ADHD; ADHD shows age-by-diagnosis effects.
- **Key Findings Detailed**: Robust neuroanatomical signatures were observed for both conditions. Autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume localized to superior temporal cortex, whereas ADHD showed more global increases in cortical thickness but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The co-occurring autism+ADHD group showed widespread increases in cortical thickness with some decreases in surface area. Sex modulated autism neuroanatomy (sex-specific profiles differ) but not ADHD; an age-by-diagnosis interaction was present for ADHD. Effect sizes were generally small, and sensitivity analyses (global measure control; QC variants) indicated stability of main findings.
- **Key Limitations**: Residual site heterogeneity cannot be fully eliminated; centiles generated out-of-sample despite overlap with original BrainCharts to account for site differences; hemispheric averaging due to model availability may mask asymmetry; limited and inconsistent phenotypic/diagnostic data (no IQ modeling); sample representativeness issues (sex imbalance, fewer lower-IQ/high-support participants, limited racial-ethnic diversity); lack of longitudinal data.
- **Application Notes**: Two-step harmonization and modeling: ComBat by site with covariates (age, sex, diagnosis) followed by out-of-sample BrainCharts GAMLSS centiles; rigorous QC with FSQC thresholding and Euler covariate; spin tests for spatial map comparisons; sensitivity analyses controlling for global measures and varying QC thresholds.

## General Notes

**General Notes**: Subcortical/cerebellar normative models were not available at analysis time; hemispheric averages were used since BrainCharts hemisphere-specific models were unavailable. The supplement compares out-of-sample centiles (site-resolved) to original in-sample centiles for ABIDE, showing high correlations (GMV r=0.88; WMV r=0.91; sGMV r=0.93; ventricular volume r=0.97).
