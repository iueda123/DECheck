## Assessment Items - Group A

### 1. Clarity of Research Objectives

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The paper states it applies population (normative) modeling to a large multisite MRI sample to characterise cortical anatomy in autism and ADHD while examining sex, age, and trait effects.
- **Supporting Text**: METHODS: Here, we used population modeling and a large, multisite neuroimaging dataset ( N = 4255 after quality control) to characterize cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of average brain development... We also examined sex and age differences and relationship with autistic traits and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD.

### 2. Clear Definition of Target Population

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: Medium
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: They describe including MRI participants with primary autism, ADHD, or control status and provide sample sizes, sex counts, and age ranges, but diagnostic criteria and control definitions rely on cited datasets without clear description in this article.
- **Supporting Text**: The final dataset after quality control (QC) included 4255 individuals (1869 typically developing control participants [687 female, 1182 male], 987 individuals with ADHD [270 female, 717 male], and 1399 autistic individuals [288 female, 1111 male], ages 2 -64 years [mean 14.0, median 12.4])... Individuals with magnetic resonance imaging data and a primary diagnosis of autism or ADHD or no diagnosis were included.
Before quality control, our sample included data from 4736 participants (2006 typically developing (TD) controls [1289 male/717 female], 1103 individuals with ADHD [809 male; 294 female], and 1627 autistic individuals [1296 male; 331 female]), with an age range of 2-64 (mean age = 13.67; median age = 11.98).

### 3. Clarity of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Inclusion is limited to MRI participants with recorded diagnoses, and they document manual FSQC screening with a 2.5 cutoff plus Euler-number covariate, along with pre- and post-QC sample counts in Supplementary tables.
- **Supporting Text**: Individuals with magnetic resonance imaging data and a primary diagnosis of autism or ADHD or no diagnosis were included... A subset of individuals with documented cooccurring autism and ADHD were examined in further analyses.
Quality Control. All scans underwent manual QC of raw image and FreeSurfer surface reconstructions using our FSQC tool (107)... A cutoff of 2.5 was used for FSQC...
Before quality control, our sample included data from 4736 participants...

### 4. Validity of Normative Modeling Outcome Measures

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: They reference previously built GAMLSS lifespan models from 75,241 TD individuals and explain generating 0–1 centile scores via Brent's maximum-likelihood estimation to quantify deviation from typical development.
- **Supporting Text**: Our previous work (98) generated reference models using generalized additive models of location scale and shape to map neuroanatomical developmental trajectories across the life span, using a sample of 75,241 TD individuals...
Out-of-sample centile scores for our study sample were generated based on these reference models using Brent's maximum likelihood estimation... Centile scores quantify variation in brain development and range from 0 to 1, with 0.5 representing the average of the reference sample.

### 5. Handling of Confounding Variables

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: They harmonised sites with ComBat using age, sex, and diagnosis covariates, added Euler number and age to all regressions, and justified not covarying IQ due to limited data and potential overcorrection.
- **Supporting Text**: ComBat was applied to the entire dataset across all global and regional measures, with each site treated as a batch and with covariates of age, sex, and diagnosis to preserve related biological variation.
All analyses included Euler number as a covariate, as well as age, to account for potential systematic age deviations in clinical groups.
We did not feel that including IQ as a covariate in our analyses was optimal... we did not have IQ from every site, and those that we did have IQ for all used differing measures.

### 6. Clarity of Data Sources

### 7. Description of Image Acquisition Protocol

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: Medium
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: Supplementary notes provide scanner models, field strengths, and head-coil information for several cohorts, but detailed sequence parameters (e.g., TR, TE) are deferred to external resources and are not consistently reported for every site.
- **Supporting Text**: The majority of [POND] scans were collected on a 3T Siemens Trio TIM scanner, with a hardware upgrade to the Siemens Prisma scanner affecting the rest of the data.
Imaging data was collected using Siemens 3T TrioTim scanner with a 32-channel head coil at RU and SI, and a Siemens 3T Prisma scanner with a 32-channel head coil at CBIC, all using an MPRAGE sequence.
Imaging data was collected using a 3T General Electrical Medical Systems HDx scanner with an 8-channel receive-only head coil.

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: Medium
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete

- **Location**: materials/1-s2.0-S0006322324015130-mmc2.pdf.md:333

### 7. External Data Validation

- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: Low
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: All analyses use the same aggregated autism/ADHD datasets with out-of-sample centiles; no independent dataset is reported for external validation of findings.
- **Supporting Text**: T1-weighted scans were combined from 49 sites across 7 datasets... The final dataset after quality control (QC) included 4255 individuals...
Separate multiple linear regressions were used to examine diagnostic group differences in centile scores for all global volumes and regional measures.

### 10. Consideration for Reproducibility

- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: Medium
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: They note software versions (FreeSurfer 6.0.1) and direct readers to publicly accessible consortia for data, yet do not mention sharing analysis code, scripts, or trained centile models.

### 11. Interpretation Specific to Normative Modeling

- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Results are framed as deviations in centile scores, highlighting diagnostic differences (e.g., autism showing higher ventricular centiles, ADHD showing lower cortical volume/surface centiles) and discussing their implications for distinct neurobiology.
- **Supporting Text**: Autistic individuals had significantly greater ventricular volume centiles than control participants... Individuals with ADHD had significantly lower total cortical and subcortical GMV, total WMV, and total cortical SA centile scores overall but greater mean CT centiles than control participants.
Significant group differences in regional centiles were much less widespread in autism than in ADHD... Autistic individuals had increased STG centiles, whereas individuals with ADHD had significantly lower CV and SA centiles across most cortical regions but higher CT centiles.

## Additional Comments

**Additional Comments**: Normative centile estimation reuses previously published Brain Chart models; readers needing scan-by-scan acquisition parameters must consult the source datasets cited in Supplementary Section 1.
