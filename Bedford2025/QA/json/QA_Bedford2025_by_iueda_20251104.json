The final dataset after\nquality control (QC) included 4255 individuals (1869 typically\ndeveloping control participants [687 female, 1182 male], 987\nindividuals with ADHD [270 female, 717 male], and 1399\nautistic individuals [288 female, 1111 male], ages 2–64 years\n[mean 14.0, median 12.4]) (Figure 1). For details of each\ndataset, demographics before and after QC, and group differences, see Supplemental Methods Section 1. It is important\nto note the distinction between biological sex and gender\nidentity, both of which may influence presentation (12). Here,\nwe refer to sex assigned at birth, but we acknowledge the\noverlap with and influence of gender socialization and the lack\nof data available to examine gender identity effects. Individuals\nwith magnetic resonance imaging data and a primary diagnosis of autism or ADHD or no diagnosis were included. Individuals were initially included in the group of their primary\ndiagnosis. A subset of individuals with documented cooccurring autism and ADHD were examined in further analyses.",
