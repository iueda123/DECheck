The abstract states the study used population modeling to characterize cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of average brain development. The introduction explicitly states: 'Here, we leveraged models of average brain development previously characterized by our group to quantify alterations related to autism and ADHD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use population modeling to investigate gray matter alterations related to these conditions in comparison to a common reference sample. We examined sources of variability related to sex, age, and measures of autistic and ADHD traits. Finally, we examined whether a subset of individuals with cooccurring autism and ADHD presented with distinct alterations.' The PICO elements are clearly identifiable: Population (autism and ADHD), Intervention/Exposure (normative modeling application), Comparator (typically developing controls), and Outcome (individual-level deviation patterns in brain anatomy).",

Software versions are specified: 'T1 images from each dataset were processed using FreeSurfer, version 6.0.1 (105)' and 'Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated using the 't_to_d' function in the 'effectsize' package in R (117).' The normative models are available through the referenced BrainCharts work. However, code availability is not explicitly mentioned in the paper. Data availability is discussed with limitations: 'Data from multiple publicly available datasets (ABIDE, HBN, ADHD200, Female ASD, UCSD) are mentioned, but the POND and UK-AIMS datasets may have restricted access. The paper states regarding limitations: 'the lack of consistent phenotypic and diagnostic information led to limited data in the analyses of clinical measures.' There is no explicit statement about code sharing (e.g., 'Code is available at...' or 'Code available upon request'). The Methods reference the FSQC tool and other established tools, but availability of custom analysis scripts is not mentioned. Given these partial descriptions, reproducibility is possible but not fully facilitated.",

      "reason": "The interpretation of individual-level deviation patterns and their clinical significance is thoroughly discussed. The study explains centile scores: 'Centile scores quantify variation in brain development and range from 0 to 1, with 0.5 representing the average of the reference sample.' Clinical implications are discussed: 'Population modeling provides a framework for studying diverse conditions in reference to a common baseline, which allows us to better quantify individual differences and address heterogeneity and multisite datasets. Population modeling also provides a potential route toward clinical and translational applications of neuroimaging (101). Similar to the use of pediatric growth charts, by characterizing typical brain development, we can identify individually specific alterations from these trajectories that may be associated with neurodevelopmental conditions even before associated traits manifest clinically.' The Discussion addresses advantages over traditional approaches: 'Previous population modeling studies on a single diagnostic cohort have mainly observed divergence from typical brain development in individualized patterns... We note that our sample size is considerably larger than that of previous studies, so while we also observed individualized patterns of centile scores, we may have had more power to detect average group differences.' The study also examines individual-level patterns: 'We also examined the amount of regional overlap in participants in each group with the greatest divergences from the average centile score.' Prospects for clinical application are realistically discussed with acknowledgment of limitations.",

    "additional_comments": "This is a high-quality, large-scale normative modeling study with several strengths: (1) Very large sample size (N=4255 after QC) from multiple sites and datasets, providing robust statistical power; (2) Sex-balanced analysis with explicit examination of sex differences, addressing a major gap in the field; (3) Comprehensive quality control procedures with detailed reporting of attrition; (4) Rigorous statistical approach with FDR correction and multiple sensitivity analyses; (5) Use of established, validated normative models (BrainCharts) based on 75,241 individuals; (6) Innovative examination of co-occurring autism+ADHD phenotype. Limitations acknowledged by authors include: (1) Multisite data with heterogeneous protocols, though harmonization was performed; (2) Small effect sizes with limited clinical significance; (3) Cortical measures averaged across hemispheres, potentially missing asymmetry effects; (4) Lack of consistent phenotypic data limiting trait-based analyses; (5) Sample representativeness issues (male-biased, limited diversity, insufficient representation of low IQ/high support needs); (6) Lack of longitudinal data preventing trajectory analysis. The study represents state-of-the-art application of normative modeling to neurodevelopmental conditions, though some methodological details (imaging parameters, training algorithms, model performance metrics) are incomplete or referenced to previous work. Code and some data availability are not explicitly stated, which may limit reproducibility. Overall, this is a methodologically rigorous study that advances understanding of autism and ADHD neurobiology through normative modeling."
