      "reason": "The paper clearly states its aims to use population (normative) modeling to characterize cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, examine effects of sex and age, investigate relationships with autistic/ADHD traits, and explore co-occurrence.",
      "supporting_text": "METHODS: Here, we used population modeling and a large, multisite neuroimaging dataset ... We also examined sex and age differences and relationship with autistic traits and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD. ... Population modeling ... provides a unified framework for studying age-specific and sex-specific divergences in brain development.",
