After normalization of the 16p11.2 controls, we observed that certain regions required small additional corrections attributed to differences in scanning parameters between the NIHPD and the 16p11.2 data (e.g. 1.5 T vs 3T scans). We estimated a linear model that included Age and Intercept (i.e. bias and slope) for the Z-scored segmented volumes and the voxel-wise log-transformed Jacobian determinants of the 16p11.2 control data.",
