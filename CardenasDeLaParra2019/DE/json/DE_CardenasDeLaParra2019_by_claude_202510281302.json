      "Confidence Rating": "High",
      "Negative Answer Category": "Not Negative",
      "Reason": "Limitations are explicitly discussed in the Discussion section, covering technical, statistical, and generalizability issues.",
      "Supporting Text": "The main limitations of the present study stem from the technical differences in acquisition, which include the aforementioned 1.5 T and 3 T fields used in the NIHPD and 16p11.2 datasets respectively. In addition, the 16p11.2 is a multi-center database, further increasing the variability in the scans. These acquisition differences can affect the quality of the non-linear registrations from which the Jacobians are calculated. Future work should look into improving the current normative growth curves by further considering additional potential sources of variation including, but not limited to, ancestry, MRI field strength and other demographic variables. The broad age range could have introduced systematic age-dependent motion artefacts leading to spurious findings. This is however unlikely due to the absence of any age-related findings in our analysis and the thorough quality check performed on the dataset. Our power to observe age-related differences was constrained by sample size. We estimate that the smallest detectable change with power = 0.80, and alpha = 0.05 in the duplication carriers for whole brain is 0.16 Z-score per year, for gray matter 0.10/year and 0.09/year for white matter. For deletions, we could detect 0.12 Z-score per year for whole brain, 0.09/year for gray matter and 0.07/year for white matter. There is also uncertainty for the lower age range of our study. A larger sample of younger participants is required to further investigate the presence of these findings at 4 years of age. Results may not generalize to 16p11.2 CNV carriers with extreme obesity or severe ASD symptoms that were unable to complete the scanning session. Nevertheless, our cohort is highly representative of the Intelligence quotient and psychiatric symptoms observed in our broader sample of 16p11.2 CNV carriers (D'Angelo et al., 2016).",

      "Answer": "This study demonstrates that neuroimaging alterations associated with genetically defined neurodevelopmental risk (16p11.2 CNVs) are present early and stable across development, contrasting with behavioral/symptom trajectories that evolve rapidly during the same period. The stability of the neuroimaging endophenotype from 4.5 to 23 years suggests brain alterations may precede or underlie symptom emergence and evolution. Results are consistent with findings in idiopathic ASD and other genetic syndromes (Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion) showing early-established brain differences. Mouse models of 16p11.2 deletion show alterations in insula and striatum at postnatal day 7 (equivalent to prenatal period in humans), suggesting very early developmental onset. The normalization approach using large external normative datasets enables study across broad age ranges despite nonlinear brain growth.
