The clinical significance is discussed: the stability of deviations across ages 4.5-23 years suggests early onset of alterations that remain stable. The advantages compared to traditional approaches are explicitly described: the normative modeling approach allows reliable study of samples spanning broad age ranges, overcoming limitations of small control groups that cannot properly model non-linear age effects. Clinical implications are discussed: the findings show a stable neuroimaging endophenotype over 2 decades during which neurodevelopmental symptoms evolve rapidly.",

Deletion carriers have higher volume than controls for total brain (mean Z-score = 1.165, p-value < 0.0001)... These global brain differences are unchanged across the full age range in our dataset... The major contribution of our paper is the use of a model to normalize the non-linear effect of age during typical brain development. This allows us to reliably study a sample of mutation carriers and controls spanning a broad age range. Papers studying neuroimaging alterations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders have mostly used narrow age bins because the study-specific control groups were too small (less than 100 individuals) to reliably model the effect of age...

      "confidence_rating": "High",
      "reason": "While the study provides extensive details about preprocessing (described comprehensively in NM-6), for the Clinical Research Part assessment, this item asks specifically about preprocessing in the context of building a new model versus using an existing model. The clinical application in this study uses the normative model already established from NIHPD data, and applies it to the clinical cohort (16p11.2 carriers). The preprocessing is not being newly developed but rather applying an established pipeline. However, given the comprehensive preprocessing description provided, this could also be considered 'Yes' depending on interpretation. Following the guideline strictly for using an existing model, the answer is 'NA'.",

    "cr6_validity_of_outcome_measures": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "confidence_rating": "High",
      "reason": "The outcome measures are clearly defined and validated. Outcomes are pre-specified: Z-scores of brain volumes (global and voxel-based) normalized for age and sex. The measurement methods are validated: the longitudinal processing pipeline was previously developed and published for NIHPD analysis. Specific software tools with established validation are used (N3, BEaST, ANIMAL algorithms, all with references). Reliability and quality control are described: visual quality control for motion artifacts, only scans passing QC included. Implementation is consistent: the same automated processing pipeline applied to all participants. While assessor blinding is not explicitly mentioned, the automated processing reduces subjective bias. Quality control procedures are uniform across all participants.",
      "supporting_text": "The longitudinal automatic image processing pipeline, developed for NIHPD analysis, was adapted to the scans from the 16p11.2 dataset... Because our analysis covers a broad age range, there is increased risk of systematic age-dependent motion artefacts. We performed a thorough visual quality control check looking for evidence of motion artefacts... Brain extraction was achieved using the Brain Extraction based on nonlocal Segmentation Technique (BEaST)... images were non-linearly registered using the Automated Nonlinear Image Matching and Anatomical Labelling (ANIMAL) algorithm... Using the mean and the estimated standard deviation of the model we were able to compute Z-scores for the global volumes of the brain as well as for each voxel independently.",

    "cr7_handling_of_confounding_variables": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "confidence_rating": "High",
      "reason": "Key confounding variables are appropriately handled. Age and sex are the primary confounders, modeled using mixed-effects models with age as quadratic function and sex as linear effect. For the multi-site study, scanner effects were tested and found non-significant, though the paper notes that extensive analyses on potential effects of scanning sites and protocols were performed in previous work. Harmonization between NIHPD (1.5T) and 16p11.2 (3T) datasets is described through linear adjustment. Additional adjustments for scan protocol differences (multi-echo vs single-echo) are implemented. The study also accounts for ancestry composition similarity between cohorts. Appropriate statistical adjustments beyond the normative model are described through linear models testing genetic status while controlling for normalized measures.",
      "supporting_text": "To compute Z-scores that normalize for the effect of growth and sex in a pediatric population, we modeled the effect of those 2 variables in the NIHPD normative dataset... we included both linear and quadratic effects of age in the fixed effects structure... Linear effect of sex was also included in the fixed terms... During model selection, a fixed effect for individual scanner was tested but found to be not significant... Extensive analyses on the potential effect of these scanning sites and protocols were performed in a previous study showing that none of the regions associated with the 16p11.2 deletion or duplication could be attributed to artefacts introduced by the multisite analyses... After normalization of the 16p11.2 controls, we observed that certain regions required small additional corrections attributed to differences in scanning parameters between the NIHPD and the 16p11.2 data (e.g. 1.5 T vs 3T scans).",
