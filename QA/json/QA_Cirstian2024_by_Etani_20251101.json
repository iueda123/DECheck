      "Supporting Text": "Note that we deliberately choose fixed parameters rather than optimizing them via nested cross-validation given the moderate sample size for the clinical data. Instead, we employed stability selection to assess the generalizability of the coefficients, which is theoretically guaranteed to provide tight type-I family-wise error control [29].In more detail, we performed 1000 random splits of the dataset into a training (70%) and test set (30%) and selected the most stable features, i.e. features that were selected in more than 80% of the splits. This threshold is justified as it is sufficiently high that the theoretical guarantees on controlling the type 1 error rate become operative. In order to assess generalizability, we then ran an additional 1000 permutations, where within each permutation, we computed the test canonical correlation averaged across 10 random splits of the data, both before and after randomly permuting the order of the PANSS data view to destroy the relationship between the symptom scores and imaging data.",

These metrics offer insight into how well the models capture the underlying distribution of the data across 48 white matter tracts. The mean (standard deviation) EV was 0.37 (0.10), indicating good fit across different models. Skewness, and kurtosis were respectively -0.09 ( 0.12) and 0.42 (0.27), which together indicate that the shape was also appropriate for the data.
