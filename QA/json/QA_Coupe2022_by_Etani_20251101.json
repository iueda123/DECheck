This dataset was com- posed of 2,655 CN subjects (CN) and 377 patients with AD.\n\nIn this study, we compared the proposed multimodel HAVAs with normative model-based strategy (i.e., using only CN model), state-of- the-art deep learning methods and classical machine learning methods.\n\nTo do that, we first estimated the mean and the SD for each structures using all the CN subjects over the entire lifespan. Then, for a given structures, we applied the same z-score normalization to all the subjects (i.e., CN, AD, and MCI). Therefore, by using z-score of normalized volumes in % of ICV, we compensated for both inter-subject and inter-structure variabilities. In the following, all the volumes are expressed as z-scores of normalized volumes.",

Moreover, in order to be able to combine several struc- tures with different sizes, we performed z-score normalization of all the normalized volumes (in percentage of ICV). To do that, we first estimated the mean and the SD for each structures using all the CN subjects over the entire lifespan.

      "Supporting Text": "All the considered images were processed using AssemblyNet soft- ware (https://github.com/volBrain/AssemblyNet) (Coupé et al., 2020). Based on collective artificial intelligence, AssemblyNet is able to produce fine-grained segmentation of the whole brain in 15 min. The AssemblyNet preprocessing pipeline was based on several steps: image denoising (Manjo\u0019n, Coupé, Martí-Bonmatí, Collins, & Robles, 2010), inhomogeneity correction (Tustison et al., 2010), affine registration to the MNI space, automatic quality control (QC) (Denis de Senneville, Manjo\u0019n, & Coupé, 2020), a second inhomogeneity correction in the MNI space (Ashburner & Friston, 2005) and a final intensity standardization step (Manjo\u0019n & Coupé, 2016).\n\nFinally, we performed a QC procedure to carefully select subjects included in our training dataset. For all the training subjects detected as failure by the automatic QC RegQCNet (Denis de Senneville et al., 2020), a visual assessment was performed by individually check- ing the input images and the segmentations produced by AssemblyNet using a 3D viewer. If the failure was confirmed by our expert, the subject was removed from training dataset.",

Therefore, we validated the generalization capacity of our method and its robustness to domain shift. In addition, we used sub- jects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from ADNI to estimate the capability of our models on prognosis task (Table 2). Consequently, we validated the generalization of our models to unseen related tasks. As in Wen et al. (2020), the MCI group was split into stable MCI (sMCI) over 3 years and progressive MCI (pMCI) who will convert to AD within 36 months following the baseline visit. Finally, we used the ClinicaDL software (https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinicadl) (Wen et al., 2020) to define the groups of AD and CN groups in AIBL, and the pMCI and sMCI groups in ADNI. Therefore, we used the same selection criteria.",

Afterwards, to select the most relevant model between these potential candidates, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978). In addition, we estimated the distance between both AD and CN models as the Euclidean distance between trajectories. Finally, we estimated the confidence interval for each model at 95% and the lifetime period for which the two models diverged significantly (i.e., when confidence intervals do not overlap).",

First, Table 7 shows the results obtained by HAVAs, amygdala, hippocampus, and inferior lateral ventricles. The obtained results are similar to the results previously obtained on AIBL. This result highlights the robustness of the proposed HAVAs strategy to training domain selection and the good generalization capability of our method.\n\nDuring the validation of HAVAs on three external datasets, we showed that our strategy enables accurate detection of subject having AD, or MCI who will convert to AD in the next 3 years (i.e., pMCI).",

      "Supporting Text": "irst, HAVAs is conceptually very simple to understand since based on the distance to AD or CN trajectories. This aspect enables an easy interpretability of the results in terms of hippocampal- amygdalo atrophy and concomitant ventricular enlargement. While current DL methods failed to produce relevant explanation on the used features for their decision making (Bron et al., 2021), HAVAs is fully interpretable and thus is well-suited for clinical practice or pharmaceutical trials. \n\nMoreover, in order to provide easily interpretable nonbinary scores to the user about the probability of the subject's status (and to be able to estimate area under curve), we proposed new scores of being an AD patient (respectively a CN subject) based on the distance to the models. This score was built to ensure that when AD score is higher than 50%, the closest model is the AD model. Moreover, we ensured that an AD score of 50% (i.e., CN score of 50%) is obtained for an equal distance between both models. To define these scores, we used the following approach.",
