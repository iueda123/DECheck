      "supporting_text": "In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared the performance of a linear and a non-linear hierarchical Bayesian model in modeling the effect of age on cortical thickness... We compared the proposed single stage hierarchical Bayesian method to several harmonization techniques commonly used to deal with additive and multiplicative site effects using a two stage regression... Our results show the value of hierarchical Bayesian regression...",

The criterion applied to mark a value as an outlier was if it was above or beyond 2 inter quartile ranges from the mean of all values for that region and hemisphere. This quite liberal criterion was applied with the aim to detect not outliers in a mathematical sense (+/- 95 % confidence interval), but to detect impossible values. This leads to the removal of 1055 out of 162905 data points (0.006%) of all values.",

In a non-linear version of the model, a Gaussian Process for age is added to test whether performance is increased if the model is also able to capture non-linear effects between age and thickness of the cortical region ('Hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Process Model, HBGPM').",
