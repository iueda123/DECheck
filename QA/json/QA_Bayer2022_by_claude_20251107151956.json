      "Reason": "The research objectives are clearly stated. The paper aims to develop and evaluate hierarchical Bayesian models for accommodating site effects in multi-site neuroimaging data within a normative modeling framework. The specific purpose is to compare the performance of hierarchical Bayesian models (linear and non-linear) against traditional harmonization methods (ComBat, regression). The application purpose is clearly stated as addressing site effects in normative modeling while retaining clinically useful information. The paper also validates the models on autism data to test their ability to preserve clinical variance.",
      "Supporting Text": "In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared the performance of a linear and a non-linear hierarchical Bayesian model in modeling the effect of age on cortical thickness... In addition, we used data from individuals with autism to test whether our models are able to retain clinically useful information while removing site effects. We compared the proposed single stage hierarchical Bayesian method to several harmonization techniques commonly used to deal with additive and multiplicative site effects using a two stage regression",

The normative reference population consists of 569 healthy controls from the ABIDE dataset. Methods for quantifying individual-level deviations are detailed, including the calculation of z-scores of deviation from predicted normative mean using the posterior predictive distribution.

The split is described as 'within-site-split', meaning both training and test sets contained individuals from the same sites.

Mathematical formulations are provided for both models (Equations 1-8), including specification of priors and hyperpriors. The software tool used is Stan (version 2.25), a probabilistic programming language for Bayesian inference.

      "Reason": "The study includes validation on a separate clinical population (autism sample, n=482) which could be considered a form of external validation for testing clinical utility. However, this is not true external validation on an independent dataset from different sites or time periods. The autism data comes from the same ABIDE dataset and the same sites as the training data. The paper acknowledges this limitation, noting that their models are tested in a 'within-site split' scenario. The authors discuss that generalization to completely new, unseen sites would require using informed priors from the training set, citing prior work (Kia et al., 2020) that demonstrated this approach. However, the current study does not actually implement or test this cross-site generalization.",
      "Supporting Text": "Thus, training and test sets contained individuals from the same sites ('withinsite-split')... The between-site split and the model at its current state only allow generalizations to a test set which includes individuals from the same sites as the training set, thus where the site variation is known... This use of a so called informed priors leads to more accurate and precise predictions than the broad, unspecific prior that would have to be used in cases where the distribution of the data is unknown (Kia et al., 2020). Thus, despite some loss in precision, the Bayesian framework can, in contrast to all other methods examined in this paper, be adapted to make predictions to new, unknown sites.",

Differences and advantages compared to traditional approaches are extensively discussed: the paper contrasts normative modeling with case-control studies, explaining how normative modeling captures individual-level heterogeneity that group comparisons miss.

      "additional_comments": "This is a methodologically rigorous study that makes an important contribution to normative modeling in multi-site neuroimaging. Strengths include: (1) comprehensive comparison of site correction methods with detailed mathematical specifications; (2) extensive validation using multiple performance metrics including both first and second-order statistics; (3) thorough reporting of convergence diagnostics and MCMC sampling quality in supplementary materials; (4) validation of clinical utility on autism data; (5) excellent reproducibility documentation with code and data sharing. Limitations acknowledged: (1) computational expense of Gaussian process models; (2) testing limited to within-site generalization rather than completely new sites; (3) age range restriction (6-40 years) may limit detection of non-linear effects; (4) averaging of left and right hemispheres may obscure laterality effects relevant to autism. The study appropriately contextualizes findings within the normative modeling literature and provides realistic discussion of clinical applications. The hierarchical Bayesian approach represents a conceptual advancement over two-stage harmonization methods by modeling site effects within a unified framework, thereby avoiding inadvertent removal of biologically meaningful variance. The finding that two-stage harmonization methods lose >90% of original variance is particularly important for the field."
