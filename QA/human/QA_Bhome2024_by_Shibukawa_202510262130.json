      "Supporting Text": "Here, we employed neuroanatomical normative modelling to investigate heterogeneity in Lewy body diseases and evaluate the potential of this technique to provide useful measures of disease severity...\nWe hypothesised that there would be a) significant differences in total number of regional outliers between high and poor visual performance PD groups, and in PD compared with DLB; b) greater dissimilarity in individual patients for low versus high visual performers in PD; and for DLB compared to PD. Finally, we predicted c) that greater total outlier count would be associated with poorer cognitive performance in PD and DLB.",
