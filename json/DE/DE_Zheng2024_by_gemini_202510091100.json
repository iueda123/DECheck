It constitutes a weighted average of the local (noise contrast ratio) and global (inhomogeneity contrast ratio) standard deviations within the optimized white matter segment scaled by the minimum tissue contrast, and the root mean square of the voxel size. A pdf is created for all subjects that contains a percentage rating (0-100%) and a corresponding letter value (F - A+) for noise, bias (inhomogeneity), resolution and IQR. The obtained quality ratings indicate images with good quality (grad A+, A and B) and modulate quality (grad C, D and E) and low quality (grad F, indicating problematic images). An image was classified as to fail QC if it had a noise grade less than or equal to 'C' (70%) and a total IQR grade of less than 'B'(80%). We applied the cut-off (>=80%, >= grad B) to ensure high quality images for analysis as lowquality images can lead to GM underestimations in preprocessing. The general IQR ratings in this study were 86.4% ± 0.74% (mean ± sd) in Dataset 1 and 86.3% ± 0.72% (mean ± sd) in Dataset 2.",
