    "key_findings_detailed": "Using quantile regression-based normative modeling and hierarchical clustering of individual GMV deviations (z50 maps), two subtypes emerged across 174 drug-naïve/drug-free patients (MDD and BD): Subtype 1 (n=112: 74 MDD, 38 BD) and Subtype 2 (n=62: 40 MDD, 22 BD). Clinical diagnosis distribution did not differ between subtypes (χ²=0.04, p=0.83), indicating trans-diagnostic subtypes. Subtype 1 exhibited supra-normal GMV deviations (z95>1.96, z5<-1.96, p<0.05) in frontal cortex (orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal), cingulate cortex, and paracentral cortex, with >57.4% of regions showing supra-normal deviations, particularly in prefrontal, cingulate, and paracentral areas. Cognitively, Subtype 1 showed significant impairment on WCST: worse perseverative errors (t=4.00, pFDR=0.001), correct responses (t=-3.65, pFDR=0.001), and completed categories (t=-3.63, pFDR=0.001) vs. HC. PLS analysis revealed spatial correlation between GMV deviations and gene expression (r=0.52, p=0.0017, explaining 26.38% covariance), with genes enriched in Alzheimer's disease pathways (pFDR<0.05), blood/cell morphogenesis, and cellular component processes. Virtual histology showed significant enrichment in endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes compared to Subtype 2 (chi-squared pFDR<0.05). PRS-AD was significantly elevated vs. HC at 4 p-value thresholds (1.0e-06, 1.0e-03, 1.0e-02, 0.1), explaining 4.2-5.9% of variance (pFDR<0.05). Subtype 2 displayed widespread infra-normal deviations (z95>1.96, z5<-1.96, p<0.05) across frontal, temporal, parietal, cingulate cortex, with 90% of regions showing infra-normal pattern. Clinically, Subtype 2 had significantly higher HAMD total scores (23.82±8.9 vs. 20.08±7.5, t=2.67, pFDR=0.025), particularly in guilt (t=2.16, p=0.032), early insomnia (t=2.369, p=0.019), insight (t=2.16, p=0.032), and general somatic symptoms (t=2.219, p=0.028). WCST performance did not differ from HC. Symptom network analysis revealed higher global network density (0.51 vs. 0.42) and strength (6.76 vs. 5.24) in Subtype 2, with significantly greater global strength at matched density (t=10.17, p=1.0e-06). PLS analysis showed spatial gene correlation (r=0.48, p=0.0039), with enrichment in ion transport, calcium signaling, trans-synaptic signaling, and stress response pathways (pFDR<0.05). Virtual histology revealed significant enrichment in microglia (n=117 overlapped genes, permutation pFDR=0.005) and marginal enrichment in inhibitory neurons (n=157, pFDR=0.057). PRS-MDD was significantly elevated vs. HC at p<1.0e-03 threshold (1,357 SNPs), explaining 10.8% variance (pFDR<0.05). Validation in independent Dataset 2 (n=268 medicated patients) showed significant correlations of regional GMV deviation patterns: Subtype 1 (r=0.29, p<0.05), Subtype 2 (r=0.45, p<0.0001), with top 10 regions showing consistent supra-normal (Subtype 1 frontal) and infra-normal (Subtype 2 frontal/cingulate) patterns across datasets.",
    "key_limitations": "Use of AHBA gene expression profiles from healthy human brains may not reflect transcriptional differences in patients with mood disorders. AHBA right hemisphere data limited to 2 participants restricts representation of whole-brain spatial correlation between transcription and GMV deviations. Small genetic data sample size (Subtype 1 n=19, Subtype 2 n=29, HC n=160) limits power for PRS analyses. Cognitive function assessment limited to WCST only; additional cognitive batteries needed for comprehensive neuropsychological profiling. Lack of specific data about illness severity of first episode in medication-free patients prevented examining associations between GMV alterations and prior depressive/anxious/psychotic symptoms.",
    "application_notes": "Study demonstrates trans-diagnostic approach to subtyping mood disorders based on neurobiological features rather than traditional diagnostic categories (both MDD and BD represented in each subtype). Multi-omics integration (neuroimaging + transcriptomics + genetics) provides mechanistic insights: Subtype 1 may represent inflammatory/vascular subtype with AD-related pathophysiology involving endothelial dysfunction and demyelination, while Subtype 2 may reflect neurodevelopmental/synaptic subtype with GABAergic and microglial dysfunction. Authors suggest limited immediate clinical application but highlight potential for precision medicine: identifying cognitive impairment subtype (Subtype 1) with AD risk may inform early intervention strategies, while severe depression subtype (Subtype 2) with MDD genetic vulnerability may guide treatment selection. Replication in medicated patients suggests robustness of imaging phenotypes across medication status, supporting clinical utility. Future work should examine treatment response differences between subtypes and test whether subtype-specific interventions improve outcomes."
