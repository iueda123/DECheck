This study applied normative modelling only to males to reduce sex-related heterogeneity whereas Zahibi et al. utilized both males and females and used sex as a factor in the model.

    "general_notes": "This study represents an important methodological advance in autism neuroimaging by demonstrating that conventional case-control findings can be misleading when driven by small outlier subgroups. The normative modeling approach using LOESS regression identified that only ~7.6% of ASD males show age-atypical cortical thickness, primarily in childhood-to-early-adult years (6-20 years), with prevalence declining in later ages. Critically, removal of these outliers eliminated 48% of case-control findings (27→14 regions), revealing that most \"significant\" group differences are not representative of the broader ASD population. The study utilized matched samples of N\u003d699 ASD and N\u003d624 TD males from ABIDE I+II after rigorous QC (Euler index-based exclusion of top 10% poor quality scans). Site and age each explained ~15% of CT variance, handled via LME with site random effects. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses (systematic motion/Euler exclusion, bootstrap validation with 1,000 iterations, centile cross-validation) demonstrated robustness. The w-score framework enabled novel brain-behavior discoveries: SRS correlated with lateral frontal/parietal regions while ADOS correlated with lateral/inferior temporal regions—spatial patterns distinct from case-control maps. Only 14 individuals showed global CT atypicality (\u003e50% regions outlier), likely reflecting residual image quality issues. Multivariate analyses (tSNE + k-medoid clustering) found ASD variation entirely nested within TD variation, supporting the 3rd scenario in Marquand et al.\u0027s (2016) conceptual framework. Supplementary analyses confirmed the same pattern across volume, surface area, and gyrification (all case-control effects eliminated by outlier removal). The study notes partial consistency with independent EU-AIMS LEAP cohort findings despite different normative methods (LOESS vs GPR) and samples. Key datasets: ABIDE I and II processed with FreeSurfer v5.3.0, parcellated into 308 equal-area (~500mm²) regions via subdivision of Desikan-Killiany atlas, with additional 360-region HCP multi-modal parcellation. The approach has important implications for understanding heterogeneity in ASD and moving toward precision medicine, though cross-sectional design limits trajectory inference and sample restrictions (males only, IQ≥70) limit generalizability."
