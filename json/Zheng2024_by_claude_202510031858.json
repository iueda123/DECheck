PLS1-Subtype 2 showed positive gene expression in occipital cortex and negative in frontal/cingulate/temporal cortex, spatially correlated with GMV deviations (r=0.48, p=0.0039), enriched in ion transport, calcium signaling, trans-synaptic signaling, stress response biological processes (pFDR<0.05), significantly enriched in microglia (117 genes, permutation pFDR=0.005) and marginally in inhibitory neurons (157 genes, permutation pFDR=0.057). Genetic risk: Subtype 1 (n=19 with genetic data) showed significant PRS-AD differences from HC (n=160) at four p-value thresholds (1.0e-06, 1.0e-03, 1.0e-02, 0.1) explaining 4.2-5.9% variance (pFDR<0.05), while Subtype 2 showed no PRS-AD differences. Subtype 2 (n=29) showed significant PRS-MDD difference from HC at threshold 1.0e-03 explaining 10.8% variance (pFDR<0.05), while Subtype 1 showed no PRS-MDD differences. Replication: GMV deviation patterns replicated in Dataset 2 (268 medicated patients) with significant spatial correlations (Subtype 1: r=0.29, p<0.05; Subtype 2: r=0.45, p<0.0001); top 10 regions with extreme deviations consistent across datasets. Distribution of MDD/BD diagnoses did not differ between subtypes (χ²=0.04, p=0.83), and no demographic differences (age, sex, education) between subtypes.",
      "key_limitations": "Cross-sectional design limits inference about developmental trajectories and causality; Gene expression profiles from AHBA healthy brain tissue may not reflect transcription in patients with mood disorders; AHBA right hemisphere data only available for 2 participants, restricting spatial correlation analysis to left hemisphere (34 regions instead of full 68); Small genetic data sample size (Subtype 1: n=19, Subtype 2: n=29, HC: n=160) limits power for PRS analysis; Limited cognitive assessment using only WCST, other cognitive batteries not evaluated; No data on illness severity at first episode in medication-free patients, preventing associations between GMV alterations and prior symptom severity; Replication cohort (Dataset 2) consisted of medicated patients, introducing potential medication confounds despite validation of GMV deviation patterns; Single-site, single-scanner design limits generalizability to other populations, scanning protocols, and field strengths; Quantile regression method and clustering approach differ from other normative modeling studies (e.g., GPR, GAMLSS), limiting direct comparability; No explicit validation of normative model adequacy (e.g., model fit metrics like EV, MSLL, distributional checks on HC deviations); Moderate sample sizes for subtypes (Subtype 1: n=112, Subtype 2: n=62) may limit detection of within-subtype heterogeneity",
      "application_notes": "Novel hierarchical clustering based on individual GMV deviation maps (z50) rather than raw GMV or traditional case-control comparisons; Subtyping transcends traditional diagnostic boundaries (MDD and BD represented in both subtypes); Multi-dimensional validation combining clinical behaviors, transcriptomics, and genetics strengthens biological validity of subtypes; Three deviation metrics (z5, z50, z95) provide comprehensive characterization of individual positions relative to normative range; Categorical classification (infra-normal, normal, supra-normal) enables quantification of abnormality rate and extent at group level; Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) with 10-fold cross-validation and 1000 permutations ensures clustering stability; Symptom network analysis (graph theory) reveals different patterns of symptom interactions between subtypes beyond simple severity differences; Virtual histology approach linking GMV deviations to specific cell types (excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, OPC) provides mechanistic insights; PLS regression with spatial bootstrapping identifies genes whose expression patterns spatially align with deviation patterns; Findings suggest Subtype 1 may represent inflammatory/vascular pathophysiology related to Alzheimer's disease risk, while Subtype 2 reflects neurodevelopmental abnormalities related to GABAergic dysfunction; Replication in independent medicated cohort demonstrates robustness of imaging phenotypes despite medication effects; Code and results openly available at https://github.com/zhengjunjie1234/Mood_Disorders_subtypeing.git; Approach advances toward precision medicine by identifying biologically distinct subgroups that may benefit from targeted interventions"

      "general_notes": "This study represents an important advance in characterizing heterogeneity in mood disorders by integrating normative modeling of brain structure with multi-dimensional validation including clinical phenotypes, spatial transcriptomics, and polygenic risk profiles. The discovery cohort included 174 drug-naïve or drug-free patients (114 MDD, 60 BD) and 404 healthy controls, all recruited from First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, and scanned on a single Signa HDx 3.0T GE scanner. Quantile regression normative modeling was applied to 68 cortical regions (Desikan-Killiany atlas) processed with CAT12/SPM12 VBM pipeline, with rigorous quality control (IQR ≥80%, grade ≥B, mean IQR 86.4±0.74%). Two distinct subtypes emerged: Subtype 1 (n=112) characterized by supra-normal GMV deviations predominantly in frontal/cingulate cortex (57.4% of regions), cognitive impairment on WCST, higher Alzheimer's disease genetic risk (PRS-AD explaining 4.2-5.9% variance), and transcriptional association with oligodendrocytes/endothelial cells and Alzheimer's disease pathways; Subtype 2 (n=62) characterized by globally decreased GMV deviations (90% of regions infra-normal), more severe depressive symptoms (HAMD 23.82 vs 20.08, pFDR=0.025), higher symptom network connectivity strength, higher MDD genetic vulnerability (PRS-MDD explaining 10.8% variance), and transcriptional association with microglia/inhibitory neurons and GABAergic/stress-response pathways. Critically, diagnostic categories (MDD vs BD) were distributed equally across subtypes (χ²=0.04, p=0.83), suggesting that neurobiological heterogeneity transcends traditional nosological boundaries. Subtype 1's association with endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and AD genetic risk suggests a pathophysiology involving inflammatory processes, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and myelination abnormalities potentially related to cognitive impairment and dementia risk. Subtype 2's association with microglia, inhibitory neurons, GABAergic signaling, and stress response suggests neurodevelopmental abnormalities in synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation contributing to depressive symptom severity. The findings were validated in an independent cohort of 268 medicated patients (Dataset 2) showing significant spatial correlations of GMV deviation maps (r=0.29-0.45) and consistency of top regions with extreme deviations. The study utilized Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) gene expression data (6 donors, 3702 tissue samples, 10027 genes after preprocessing) limited to left hemisphere (34 regions) due to limited right hemisphere coverage. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression identified genes whose spatial expression patterns covaried with GMV deviations, with PLS1 components explaining 26.38% (Subtype 1) and similar variance (Subtype 2) of GMV deviation patterns. Virtual histology analysis assigned genes to seven canonical cell types, revealing distinct cell-type enrichments between subtypes (endothelial/oligodendrocytes for Subtype 1, microglia/inhibitory neurons for Subtype 2, chi-squared pFDR<0.05). Polygenic risk analysis based on large GWAS datasets (AD: 71880 cases + 383378 controls; MDD: 135458 cases + 344901 controls) demonstrated differential genetic vulnerabilities, though sample sizes for genetic data were limited (19-29 per subtype). Methodological strengths include: drug-naïve/drug-free patient sample minimizing medication confounds, rigorous automated quality control, multi-percentile deviation metrics (z5, z50, z95), robust clustering validation (10-fold CV, 1000 permutations, ARI scores), comprehensive symptom assessment (HAMD, HAMA, BPRS, WCST), integration of spatial transcriptomics and genetics, and replication in independent cohort. Limitations include: cross-sectional design, single-site/single-scanner (limiting generalizability), AHBA left hemisphere restriction, small genetic sample, no normative model validation metrics (EV, MSLL), no explicit cross-validation of normative model, and potential medication effects in replication cohort. The study advances conceptualization of mood disorders from categorical diagnoses to dimensional neurobiological subtypes, with implications for precision medicine approaches targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms. Key datasets: Discovery (Dataset 1) with N=404 HC for normative model, N=174 patients for clustering; Replication (Dataset 2) with N=268 medicated patients. T1-MRI acquisition: 3D FSPGR, TR/TE=7.2/3.2ms, FA=13°, 1.0mm³ isotropic voxels, 176 slices. Preprocessing: CAT12 VBM with DARTEL normalization to MNI IXI555 space, modulated GMV, TIV covariate. All code/data available at https://github.com/zhengjunjie1234/Mood_Disorders_subtypeing.git. The approach provides a framework for future mechanistic studies and clinical trials stratified by neurobiological subtype rather than traditional diagnostic categories."
