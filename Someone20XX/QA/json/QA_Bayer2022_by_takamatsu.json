      "supporting_text": "\nFor these reasons, we suggest an alternative approach to deal with site effects in neuroimaging data. While we focus in particular on normative modeling, our approach can be also applied to other neuroimaging data analyses scenarios. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach in which we include site as a random effect in the model, avoiding the exclusion of meaningful variance correlated with site by predicting site effects as part of the model instead of removing them from the data.\nThis approach is similar to the approach by Kia et al. (2020), who used hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) in a similar way for multi-site normative modeling in a pooled neuroimaging data set, which contained 7499 participants who were scanned with 33 different scanners. Kia et al. (2020)’s estimate of site variation is based on a partial pooling approach, in which the variation between site-specific parameters is bound by a shared prior. The approach showed better performance when evaluated with respect to metrics accounting for the quality of the predictive mean and variance compared to a complete pooling of site parameters and to ComBat harmonization, and similar performance to a no-pooling approach, with the benefit of reduced risk of over-fitting due to the shared site variance. Moreover, Kia et al. (2020) also showed that the posterior distribution of site parameters from the training set can also be used as an informed prior to make predictions in an unseen, new test set, outperforming predictions from complete pooling and uninformed priors. The method was also able to preserve and parse heterogeneity between individuals with varying clinical diagnoses in associated brain regions of 1017 clinical patients of the study.\nThe present paper is a replication and extension of the approach by Kia et al. (2020).\n+それに次ぐセクション",
