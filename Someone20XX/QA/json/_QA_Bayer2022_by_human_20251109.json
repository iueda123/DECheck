      "supporting_text": "\n1)In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared the performance of a linear and a non-linear hierarchical Bayesian model in modeling the effect of age on cortical thickness.\n2)We show that the hierarchical Bayesian models including a site parameter perform better than existing methods for dealing with additive and multiplicative site effects, including ComBat and regressing out site. Subsequently, we validate the hierarchical Bayesian models in the autism sample of the ABIDE data set and test their ability to retain clinically useful variance while correcting for site effects. We discuss the normative hierarchical Bayesian methods with regard to their implications for neuroimaging data-sharing initiatives and their use as general technique to correct for site effects.",
