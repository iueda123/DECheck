The study demonstrates removal of site effects (partial η²<0.001 in training, p=1.0) and discusses handling of site heterogeneity, but does not validate against other types of nuisance structure (e.g., motion, scanner drift, different acquisition protocols from unseen sites).",

The split preserved the distribution of age, sex, and site between training and test sets.

Thus, training and test sets contained individuals from the same sites ('within-site-split')... The normative models were trained on a training set consisting of healthy individuals from the ABIDE data set (70% of the data from 20 different sites, within-site split, preserving the distribution of age and sex across training and test set) and we presented results from generalization to a test set (the remaining 30% of the data from the same sites).",

All validation was performed using a within-site split where both training and test sets contained individuals from the same 20 sites. The authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation, noting that the current model only allows generalizations to test sets from sites included in the training set. They discuss that generalization to new, unknown sites would require using informed priors, but this was not tested in the current study.",
      "supporting_text": "Secondly, the between-site split and the model at its current state only allow generalizations to a test set which includes individuals from the same sites as the training set, thus where the site variation is known. However, especially in clinical settings, generalizing the model and making predictions in data from new sites is an important additional goal...

For correlation between true and predicted values: HBLM training ρ=0.734, test ρ=0.694; HBGPM training ρ=0.752, test ρ=0.705; versus modified ComBat training ρ=0.541, test ρ=0.568. For SRMSE: HBLM training 0.061, test 0.066; HBGPM training 0.059, test 0.064; versus modified ComBat training 0.076, test 0.075. For explained variance: HBLM training 56.7%, test 50%; HBGPM training 54%, test 48.5%; versus modified ComBat training 31.5%, test 33.8%. Both hierarchical models achieved negative MSLL (better prediction than training set mean). Critically, hierarchical Bayesian models retained 57-65% of original test set variance compared to <30% for harmonization methods. Site effects were effectively removed: raw data showed partial η²=0.58 (training), 0.55 (test), 0.51 (autism); after HBGPM correction, partial η²<0.001 (p=1.0) in training, 0.08 (p=0.03) in test, 0.19 (p=0.04) in autism. Clinical validity was demonstrated by 7.2-7.8% atypical z-scores in autism versus expected 5.5-5.7% in controls, with regional patterns consistent with prior literature.",
    "key_limitations": "1) High computational cost: approximately 25 hours per region for HBGPM due to Gaussian Process covariance matrix computation, making it challenging for whole-brain voxel-wise analysis; 2) Current model limited to within-site validation and cannot generalize to new/unknown sites without using informed priors (not tested in this study); 3) Does not account for spatial correlations between different brain regions as modeling was performed independently for each region; 4) Limited age range (6-40 years) may not capture full non-linear age effects across the lifespan; 5) Potential laterality effects in autism may be concealed by averaging left and right hemispheres; 6) Model requires sufficient sample size per site for stable random effect estimation.",
    "application_notes": "This study represents a replication and extension of Kia et al. (2020)'s hierarchical Bayesian regression approach, using independent data (ABIDE vs. their multi-site dataset) and adding non-linear Gaussian Process modeling. The approach demonstrates that including site as a predictor within a single-stage normative model is superior to two-stage harmonization approaches that remove site effects prior to modeling. The resulting z-scores can serve as 'cleaned' measures for downstream analyses. The partial pooling approach allows site-specific parameters to share information through hierarchical priors while maintaining semi-independence. Code and methods are made publicly available on GitHub, enhancing reproducibility."
