#### NM Vldtn Handle NS
- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The study's primary focus is to address site effects, a form of nuisance structure. The hierarchical Bayesian model is designed to handle this.
- **Supporting Text**: In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model.
- **Location**: Abstract

#### NM Vldtn Same Domain Nonindep
- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The model is trained on a training set and performance is reported on that same set.
- **Supporting Text**: The normative models were trained on a training set consisting of healthy individuals from the ABIDE data set (70% of the data from 20 different sites, within-site split, preserving the distribution of age and sex across training and test set) and we presented results from generalization to a test set (the remaining 30% of the data from the same sites).
- **Location**: Discussion

#### NM Vldtn Same Domain Indep
- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The model is validated on a held-out test set from the same dataset.
- **Supporting Text**: To evaluate the performance of the models, we split the the healthy control data set into a training set (70% of data, n=389) and a test set (30% of data, n=166) using the R package caret and splitstackshape, while the distribution of age, sex and site was preserved between sets.
- **Location**: Methods 3.3

#### NM Vldtn Diff Domain
- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The study doesn't validate the model on a different domain dataset.
- **Supporting Text**: The paper does not mention using a different domain dataset for validation.

- **Association Analysis**: The study compared the percentage of atypical z-scores ( |z| > 1.96) between the ASD group and the healthy control test set.
- **Key Findings Brief**: A hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach effectively accommodates site effects in multi-site neuroimaging data, outperforming standard harmonization techniques while preserving clinically relevant variance.
- **Key Findings Detailed**: The proposed hierarchical Bayesian models (HBLM and HBGPM) demonstrated superior performance in modeling cortical thickness across sites compared to methods like ComBat and simple regression of site effects. The models substantially reduced site-related variance in the derived z-scores, while retaining the ability to detect atypical brain development in individuals with autism, showing a higher percentage of atypical z-scores in the autism group (7.2-7.8%) compared to healthy controls (5.5-5.7%).
- **Key Limitations**: The models were not tested on data from new, unseen sites. The computational cost of the non-linear Gaussian Process model is high. The analysis averaged across hemispheres, potentially obscuring laterality effects in autism. The model does not account for correlations between different brain measures.
