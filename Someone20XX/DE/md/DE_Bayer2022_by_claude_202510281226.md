#### NM Vldtn Handle NS
- **Answer**: Partial
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Unclear/Incomplete
- **Reason**: The study explicitly addresses site-related nuisance structure through hierarchical Bayesian modeling with site as a random effect. The model accounts for site-specific variance and mean shifts. However, the validation is performed within the same sites (within-site split), not testing generalization to new sites with potentially different nuisance structures. The study demonstrates removal of site effects (partial η²<0.001 in training, p=1.0) and discusses handling of site heterogeneity, but does not validate against other types of nuisance structure (e.g., motion, scanner drift, different acquisition protocols from unseen sites).
- **Supporting Text**: Site was entered as a random effect with partial pooling into the hierarchical Bayesian model... we could show that the hierarchical Bayesian models retained more variance and were able to remove site effects to a higher degree than the other tested models... The effect size for site in the raw data was partial η²=0.58 (training set), partial η²=0.55 (test set), and partial η²=0.51 (autism data). For the HBGPM corrected data, the effect size for site was partial η²<0.001 (p=1.0) for the training set, partial η²=0.08 (p=0.03) for the test set, and partial η²=0.19 (p=0.04) for the autism data.

#### NM Vldtn Same Domain Nonindep
- **Answer**: Yes
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The model was validated using a test set (30% of healthy controls, n=166) from the same ABIDE dataset and same 20 sites as the training set (70%, n=389). The split preserved the distribution of age, sex, and site between training and test sets. This represents same-domain, non-independent validation as the data comes from the same acquisition sites with the same scanning protocols, though different individuals. Performance metrics were reported for both training and test sets.
- **Supporting Text**: To evaluate the performance of the models, we split the healthy control data set into a training set (70% of data, n=389) and a test set (30% of data, n=166) using the R package caret and splitstackshape, while the distribution of age, sex and site was preserved between sets. Thus, training and test sets contained individuals from the same sites ('within-site-split')... The normative models were trained on a training set consisting of healthy individuals from the ABIDE data set (70% of the data from 20 different sites, within-site split, preserving the distribution of age and sex across training and test set) and we presented results from generalization to a test set (the remaining 30% of the data from the same sites).

#### NM Vldtn Same Domain Indep
- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The study did not validate the model on independent sites from the same domain (i.e., different ABIDE sites not included in training). All validation was performed using a within-site split where both training and test sets contained individuals from the same 20 sites. The authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation, noting that the current model only allows generalizations to test sets from sites included in the training set. They discuss that generalization to new, unknown sites would require using informed priors, but this was not tested in the current study.
- **Supporting Text**: Secondly, the between-site split and the model at its current state only allow generalizations to a test set which includes individuals from the same sites as the training set, thus where the site variation is known. However, especially in clinical settings, generalizing the model and making predictions in data from new sites is an important additional goal... A further extension of the model to make generalizations to new sites and the application to clinical data will be the objectives of future work.

#### NM Vldtn Diff Domain
- **Answer**: No
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Missing
- **Reason**: The study did not perform validation on a different domain or dataset beyond ABIDE. All normative modeling, validation, and clinical application were conducted within the ABIDE dataset only. There was no external validation using data from different cohorts, studies, or imaging protocols outside of ABIDE.
- **Supporting Text**: We used the healthy control sample from the ABIDE (autism brain imaging data exchange) data set to compare a non-linear, Gaussian process version of the model, to a linear hierarchical Bayesian version accounting for site effects... Subsequently, we validate the hierarchical Bayesian models in the autism sample of the ABIDE data set.

#### Deviation Metric
- **Answer**: Z-scores calculated as deviation from normative mean divided by predictive variance; Atypical z-scores defined as ±1.96 (corresponding to 95th percentile threshold)
- **Confidence Rating**: 
- **Negative Answer Category**: 
- **Reason**: 
- **Supporting Text**: 
- **Location**: 

- **Association Analysis**: Comparison of prevalence of atypical z-scores (±1.96 SD) between healthy control test set and autism sample using one-way ANOVA. Healthy control test set showed expected 5.7% (HBGPM) and 5.5% (HBLM) atypical z-scores, validating the models. Autism sample showed elevated rates of 7.8% (HBGPM) and 7.2% (HBLM) atypical z-scores (approximately 35-40% increase over expected), demonstrating retention of clinically meaningful variance. Regional distribution of atypical z-scores examined; autism showed patterns broadly consistent with previous literature (Bethlehem et al., 2020; Zabihi et al., 2019b) including elevated deviations in temporal and frontal regions.
- **Key Findings Brief**: Hierarchical Bayesian models (HBLM and HBGPM) outperformed traditional harmonization methods (ComBat, regression) in normative modeling of cortical thickness while effectively removing site effects and retaining clinically meaningful variation in autism.
- **Key Findings Detailed**: The hierarchical Bayesian models demonstrated superior performance across all metrics compared to harmonization approaches. For correlation between true and predicted values: HBLM training ρ=0.734, test ρ=0.694; HBGPM training ρ=0.752, test ρ=0.705; versus modified ComBat training ρ=0.541, test ρ=0.568. For SRMSE: HBLM training 0.061, test 0.066; HBGPM training 0.059, test 0.064; versus modified ComBat training 0.076, test 0.075. For explained variance: HBLM training 56.7%, test 50%; HBGPM training 54%, test 48.5%; versus modified ComBat training 31.5%, test 33.8%. Both hierarchical models achieved negative MSLL (better prediction than training set mean). Critically, hierarchical Bayesian models retained 57-65% of original test set variance compared to <30% for harmonization methods. Site effects were effectively removed: raw data showed partial η²=0.58 (training), 0.55 (test), 0.51 (autism); after HBGPM correction, partial η²<0.001 (p=1.0) in training, 0.08 (p=0.03) in test, 0.19 (p=0.04) in autism. Clinical validity was demonstrated by 7.2-7.8% atypical z-scores in autism versus expected 5.5-5.7% in controls, with regional patterns consistent with prior literature.
- **Key Limitations**: 1) High computational cost: approximately 25 hours per region for HBGPM due to Gaussian Process covariance matrix computation, making it challenging for whole-brain voxel-wise analysis; 2) Current model limited to within-site validation and cannot generalize to new/unknown sites without using informed priors (not tested in this study); 3) Does not account for spatial correlations between different brain regions as modeling was performed independently for each region; 4) Limited age range (6-40 years) may not capture full non-linear age effects across the lifespan; 5) Potential laterality effects in autism may be concealed by averaging left and right hemispheres; 6) Model requires sufficient sample size per site for stable random effect estimation.
- **Application Notes**: This study represents a replication and extension of Kia et al. (2020)'s hierarchical Bayesian regression approach, using independent data (ABIDE vs. their multi-site dataset) and adding non-linear Gaussian Process modeling. The approach demonstrates that including site as a predictor within a single-stage normative model is superior to two-stage harmonization approaches that remove site effects prior to modeling. The resulting z-scores can serve as 'cleaned' measures for downstream analyses. The partial pooling approach allows site-specific parameters to share information through hierarchical priors while maintaining semi-independence. Code and methods are made publicly available on GitHub, enhancing reproducibility.

## General Notes

**General Notes**: ABIDE dataset comprised 20 independent samples from 17 different scanning locations, all using 3T scanners but with varying sequence parameters, scanner types (Siemens, Philips, GE), and site-specific age/sex distributions. Data preprocessing used FreeSurfer standard pipeline with Desikan-Killiany atlas (34 bilateral regions). Missing values were handled differently across comparison methods: ComBat accepts missing values (n=391 training, n=168 test), while ComBat-GAM does not (n=370 training, n=156 test after exclusions). Normative modeling was performed region-wise and independently for each of the 35 regions. Model comparison included 7 approaches: HBLM, HBGPM, ComBat-GAM, ComBat, ComBat without covariates, residuals model, and raw data. Stan sampling used 4000 iterations (2000 warmup) with 4 chains; all R-hat values <1.05 indicating convergence. The study provides publicly available code on GitHub (https://github.com/likeajumprope/Bayesian_normative_models) and uses open ABIDE data, enhancing transparency and reproducibility. Performance metrics showed HBGPM slightly outperformed HBLM (ρ test: 0.705 vs 0.694; SRMSE test: 0.064 vs 0.066; EV test: 48.5% vs 50%), suggesting non-linear age effects may be present even in this limited age range. Original ABIDE sample: 1,051 healthy controls and 539 autism participants; after outlier correction: 569 healthy controls and 482 autism participants.
