- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The clinical application targets individuals with autism.

- **Location**: materials/Bayer2022.pdf.md:L125-L129

#### Clinical Groups Age
- **Answer**: ASD males: 16.9±6.5; ASD females: 15.1±5.8; range 8–39
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Age distributions for autism sample by sex and range are provided in Fig. 2.
- **Supporting Text**: Autism sample : Age male subjects: M = 16.9., SD = 6.5. Age female subjects: M = 15.1, SD = 5.8., range = 8-39;
- **Location**: materials/Bayer2022.pdf.md:L482

#### Clinical Groups Sex
- **Answer**: M 430 (89.2%), F 52 (10.8%)
- **Confidence Rating**: High
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: Male count is reported; female count derived as 482-430 with percentages computed.
- **Supporting Text**: ... 482 individuals with autism ... out of which 430 were male.
- **Location**: materials/Bayer2022.pdf.md:L125-L129

#### Deviation Metric
- **Answer**: Z-score deviations from normative model; atypicality threshold |z| ≥ 2 SD; region-wise prevalence compared to expected 5%
- **Confidence Rating**: Medium
- **Negative Answer Category**: Not Negative
- **Reason**: The abstract mentions z-scores; Figure 8 reports prevalence of atypical z-scores at ±2 SD with 5% expected threshold.
- **Supporting Text**: ... resulting z-scores showed little to no residual site effects ... Figure 8. Region specific prevalence of atypical z-scores ... Scores are thresholded at 5%, which is the expected amount of z-scores of ± 2SD
- **Location**: materials/Bayer2022.pdf.md:L67-L71; L575-L581

- **Association Analysis**: Assessed whether individual z-score deviations in the ASD test set retained clinically useful signal by examining region-wise prevalence of atypical deviations (|z|≥2 SD) relative to expected 5%, and by comparing model performance metrics (correlation, SRMSE, MSLL) indicating better scaling and variance retention in HBLM/HBGPM versus harmonization baselines.
- **Key Findings Brief**: Hierarchical Bayesian normative models (HBLM/HBGPM) best captured age-related cortical thickness with minimal residual site effects while preserving clinically informative deviations; two-stage harmonization (regress-out/ComBat) under-scaled predictions and lost >90% variance.
- **Key Findings Detailed**: On the held-out test set, mean ROI-wise correlation was 0.705 (HBGPM) and 0.694 (HBLM), exceeding mod. ComBat (0.568), ComBat (0.343), residuals (0.329) and raw (0.435). Test SRMSE was 0.064 (HBGPM) and 0.066 (HBLM), lower (better) than mod. ComBat (0.075), ComBat (0.085), residuals (0.085) and raw (0.085). MSLL and predicted vs. actual variance plots indicated HBR models retained appropriate variance scaling, whereas harmonization models were poorly scaled (loss >90% of original variance). Forest plots showed substantial site heterogeneity uncorrected, largely removed after HBLM/HBGPM.
- **Key Limitations**: Validation confined to within-domain ABIDE with within-site split; no external-domain validation; focus limited to cortical thickness (DK atlas) and automated QC; software implementation details not fully specified.
- **Application Notes**: Single-stage HBR modeling of site as a random effect provides an alternative to ComBat-style harmonization for normative modeling; comparisons included preserving vs not preserving age/sex variance in ComBat; training/test split preserved site/age/sex distributions.

## General Notes

**General Notes**: ABIDE aggregated 20 samples from 17 sites (3T scanners) with varying sequence parameters; site heterogeneity documented (Table 1). Site-specific sample sizes, sex ratios, and age ranges are listed (see Table 1 excerpt). Overall HC age statistics computed from sex-stratified means/SDs and counts.
