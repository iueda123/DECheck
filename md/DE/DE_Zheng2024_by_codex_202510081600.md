### Association Analysis

Between-subtype comparisons of clinical symptoms (HAMD/HAMA/BPRS) and cognition (WCST); construction and comparison of symptom networks via graph theory (density/strength); imaging transcriptomics using AHBA with PLS and pathway/cell-type enrichment; polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD and MDD computed via PRSice and compared between subtypes.

### Key Findings (Brief)

Two subtypes emerged: subtype 1 showed increased frontal GMV deviations with poorer cognitive performance and higher AD genetic risk, while subtype 2 showed globally decreased GMV deviations with more severe depressive symptoms and higher MDD genetic risk; regional deviation patterns replicated in an independent cohort.

### Key Findings (Detailed)

Subtyping of 174 drug-free patients yielded subtype 1 (n=112) with supra-normal deviations in frontal/cingulate/paracentral cortex and subtype 2 (n=62) with widespread infra-normal deviations (and occipital supra-normal). Subtype 2 had higher HAMD total (23.82±8.9) than subtype 1 (20.08±7.5; t=2.67, PFDR=0.025). Subtype 1 showed worse WCST performance vs HC (e.g., WCST-PE t=4.00, PFDR=0.001), while subtype 2 did not differ from HC. Symptom network density/strength were higher in subtype 2 (0.51/6.76) vs subtype 1 (0.42/5.24). Gene enrichment associated subtype 1 with AD-related pathways and oligodendrocyte/endothelial cell signatures, and subtype 2 with microglia/inhibitory neuron signatures. PRS analyses indicated higher AD risk in subtype 1 and higher MDD risk in subtype 2. Regional z50 deviation maps correlated across discovery and replication cohorts (r=0.29, p<0.05 in subtype 1; r=0.45, p<1e-4 in subtype 2).

### Key Limitations

Use of AHBA gene expression from healthy brains may not reflect patient transcription; limited right-hemisphere coverage in AHBA; relatively small genetic sample size; cognitive assessment limited to WCST; lacked specific data on first-episode illness severity.

### Application Notes

Demonstrates normative modeling-based subtyping integrating imaging, symptoms, transcriptomics, and PRS; clustering stability assessed via ARI with cross-validation; replication in independent medicated cohort from same site.

## General Notes

Single-site 3.0T GE Signa HDx; CAT12/SPM12 preprocessing with DARTEL; DK-68 ROI summarization; TIV used as covariate in analyses; no site harmonization needed due to single-site design.
